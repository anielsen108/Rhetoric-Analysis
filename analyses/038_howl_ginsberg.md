# Passage 038: "Howl"

## Author and Source
**Allen Ginsberg**, *Howl and Other Poems* (1956)

## Passage
> I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,
> dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of lines (continues throughout poem).
*Example:* "I saw" begins this prophetic vision; "who" begins subsequent lines.
*Effect:* Creates accumulative, incantatory effect; mimics prophet witnessing disaster.

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-ton)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions between elements.
*Example:* "starving hysterical naked"—no "and" between adjectives.
*Effect:* Creates breathless, overwhelming accumulation; desperation piled on desperation.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Deliberate exaggeration.
*Example:* "the best minds of my generation destroyed"
*Effect:* Elevates personal observation to generational tragedy; makes individual suffering universal.

### **Catalog** (KAT-uh-log)
*Definition:* Extended list or enumeration.
*Example:* The entire poem is a catalog of suffering and seeking.
*Effect:* Creates overwhelming sense of abundance—of pain, of searching, of experience.

### **Prophetic Voice** (proh-FET-ik voys)
*Definition:* Speaking as witness to truth others miss.
*Example:* "I saw"—claims visionary authority.
*Effect:* Positions speaker as prophet; personal experience becomes revelation.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Declarative Opening
"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness"—**subject-verb-object** structure, but the object is enormously weighty. The **past tense "saw"** claims eye-witness authority, prophetic vision.

The **superlative "best minds"** makes the claim absolute. The syntax doesn't hedge—THE best, not "some good minds."

The **passive construction "destroyed by madness"** emphasizes victimhood. The syntax through passive makes madness the agent, minds the victims.

### Asyndetic Accumulation
"starving hysterical naked"—three **adjectives without conjunctions**. The syntax piles suffering without pause or hierarchy. Each condition is equal, simultaneous, overwhelming.

The **participial adjective "starving"** (continuous action) next to **adjective "hysterical"** (state) next to **adjective "naked"** (condition) creates syntactic variety within parallel structure.

### Present Participle Phrase
"dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix"—this **long participial phrase** extends the sentence breathlessly. The syntax doesn't pause, doesn't subordinate, just continues accumulating detail.

The **reflexive "themselves"** emphasizes the effort is self-powered, desperate, lonely.

The **prepositional phrases** stack:
- "through the negro streets" (space)
- "at dawn" (time)
- "for an angry fix" (purpose)

The syntax through preposition accumulation creates specificity—not just streets but "negro streets," not just any time but "dawn," not just a fix but an "angry fix."

### Transferred Epithet
"angry fix"—the adjective "angry" transfers emotion from seeker to sought. The syntax through this displacement suggests the fix won't satisfy, will match and perhaps increase the anger.

### Long-Line Syntax
Ginsberg's **long lines** resist traditional meter, creating what he called "breath-units"—lines as long as one breath can sustain. The syntax is additive, cumulative, refusing conventional line breaks that might provide rest.

### Stylistic Effect
Through asyndetic accumulation, extended participial phrases, and prophetic "I saw," Ginsberg creates syntax of witnessing and testimony. The form performs the content—breathless, desperate, overwhelming, refusing conventional restraints. This is syntax as howl, grammar as raw expression. The form breaks free of academic constraints just as the content describes people breaking free of social constraints.
