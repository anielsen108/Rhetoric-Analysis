## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Negation** (neh-GAY-shun)
*Definition:* Statement through denial.
*Example:* "That is no country for old men"
*Effect:* Defines through exclusion; creates sense of exile.

### **Parenthetical Aside** (pair-en-THET-ih-kul)
*Definition:* Interrupting comment.
*Example:* "—Those dying generations—"
*Effect:* Intrudes bitter observation into sensual scene.

### **Juxtaposition** (juk-stuh-puh-ZIH-shun)
*Definition:* Contrasting elements placed together.
*Example:* Young lovers beside dying generations.
*Effect:* Shows beauty and decay coexist.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Demonstrative Opening
"That is no country"—**demonstrative pronoun** points to previously mentioned or understood place. Syntax assumes shared reference.

### Negative Copula
"is no country for"—uses **negative construction** with preposition "for" indicating unsuitability. Not "old men cannot live there" but "no country FOR old men"—syntax emphasizes incompatibility.

### Enjambment
"The young / In one another's arms"—**line break** separates subject from prepositional phrase, creating pause that emphasizes "young."

### Appositive Fragment
"birds in the trees"—**noun phrase** in apposition to "young," equating humans and nature.

### Dashes Creating Interruption
"—Those dying generations—"—**em-dashes** create syntactic interruption. The observation about mortality breaks into the scene of vitality.

### Stylistic Effect
Through negation, enjambment, and parenthetical interruption, Yeats creates syntax of alienation. Form performs exclusion—syntax that denies belonging while observing beauty from outside.
