# Passage 007: Romeo and Juliet "Wherefore Art Thou"

**William Shakespeare** · *Romeo and Juliet* · c. 1597 | Act 2, Scene 2 (balcony scene)

**Occasion/Pressure:** Juliet, alone on balcony (so she thinks), must articulate the impossible bind—loving enemy requires identity annihilation.
**Persona/Stance:** Soliloquy (private musing, intimate second-person to absent beloved); desperate logic, philosophical interrogation masked as love confession.
**Thesis of Effect:** Syntax performs rational negotiation (conditionals, alternatives, parallel structures) to solve inherently irrational problem—form's clarity exposes content's impossibility.

## PASSAGE

[L1] O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
[L2] Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
[L3] Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
[L4] And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Apostrophe** (uh-PAH-struh-fee / əˈpɒstrəfi)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Direct address to absent person, abstraction, or inanimate object.
**Evidence:** "O Romeo, Romeo" — addressing him though he cannot hear (she believes)
**Effect:** Reader witnesses private interiority externalized. Apostrophe creates dramatic irony—Romeo *does* hear, making soliloquy into dialogue. Privacy collapses.
**Near-miss:** Not soliloquy per se (that's genre): apostrophe is the specific address-form within the soliloquy.

### **Epizeuxis** (EP-ih-ZOOK-sis / ˌɛpɪˈzuːksɪs)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Immediate repetition of same word without intervening words.
**Evidence:** "Romeo, Romeo" (vocative doubled)
**Effect:** Name becomes incantation. Reader feels obsessive focus—the name itself is both object of desire and obstacle. Repetition performs entrapment.
**Near-miss:** Not anaphora (repeated opening across clauses): epizeuxis is instant, no gap.

### **Rhetorical Question** (rih-TOR-ih-kul / rɪˈtɒrɪkəl)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Question asked for effect, not answer; question as statement.
**Evidence:** "wherefore art thou Romeo?" — not "where are you?" but "why are you Romeo?"
**Effect:** Philosophical interrogation. Reader experiences existential frustration—fate as nominative determinism. She's not seeking location but reasoning with cosmos.
**Risk:** Modern misreading ("wherefore" = "where"). Shakespeare trusts audience knows "wherefore" = "why."

### **Imperative (Command Form)** (im-PAIR-uh-tiv / ɪmˈpɛrətɪv)
**Lines:** L2, L3
**Definition:** Verb form expressing command, request, or entreaty.
**Evidence:** "Deny," "refuse," "be...sworn"
**Effect:** Desperation as grammar. Reader hears impossible demands (deny father, abandon name) spoken as if achievable. Imperatives expose helplessness—she can only command what cannot be done.
**Near-miss:** Not optative (wish mood): imperative is direct command, not "would that."

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis / ænˈtɪθəsɪs)
**Lines:** L2–4 (structural)
**Definition:** Balanced opposition of ideas in parallel grammar.
**Evidence:** Keep name (be Romeo) vs. reject name (not-Romeo); "thy father...thy name" vs. "I'll no longer be a Capulet"
**Effect:** Binary trap articulated in perfect balance. Reader sees no third option—syntax offers only Either/Or, making tragedy structurally inevitable.
**Risk:** Can feel schematic. Here, the life-or-death stakes justify the stark either/or.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Polysyndeton** (pol-ee-SIN-duh-ton / ˌpɒlɪˈsɪndətɒn)
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Use of multiple conjunctions in close succession.
**Evidence:** "Deny thy father AND refuse thy name"
**Effect:** Two actions linked, implying both are necessary. Reader experiences accumulation—one action insufficient, must do both. "And" makes it feel like list could continue.
**Risk:** Can slow rhythm. Here, "and" adds weight, insistence.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh / əˈnæfərə)
**Lines:** L2 (verb level)
**Definition:** Repeated opening word/structure across phrases.
**Evidence:** "Deny...and refuse" — parallel imperative verbs
**Effect:** Drumbeat command. Reader hears accumulating demands. Parallelism suggests rational sequence, though content is desperate plea.
**Risk:** Over-patterning can feel artificial. Shakespeare balances with conditional shift in L3.

### **Conditional Construction** (kun-DISH-uh-nul / kənˈdɪʃənəl)
**Lines:** L3–4
**Definition:** If-then logical structure.
**Evidence:** "if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll..."
**Effect:** Syntax performs negotiation, alternative-generation. Reader experiences logical problem-solving applied to insoluble dilemma. Rationality itself becomes ironic.
**Risk:** Conditional can distance emotion. Here, the stakes are so high the logic feels frantic.

### **Ellipsis (Omission)** (ee-LIP-sis / ɪˈlɪpsɪs)
**Lines:** L3
**Definition:** Omission of words recoverable from context.
**Evidence:** "if thou wilt not [deny thy father and refuse thy name]"
**Effect:** Economy. Reader must fill gap, actively reconstructing logic. Ellipsis assumes intimacy—no need to repeat, you know what I mean.
**Risk:** Ambiguity. Here, context makes elided content clear.

### **Chiasmus (Implicit)** (ky-AZ-mus / kaɪˈæzməs)
**Lines:** L2–4 (structural reversal)
**Definition:** Reversal of grammatical structure in parallel phrases.
**Evidence:** [You] deny [your] family → [I] deny [my] family (reversal of agent)
**Effect:** Mirroring, symmetry. Reader sees mutual sacrifice, balanced exchange. Chiastic structure implies fairness, equilibrium—if you do this, I'll do that.
**Risk:** Can feel too neat. Shakespeare's version is implicit, avoiding mechanical symmetry.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Vocative Case / Direct Address**
**Lines:** L1
**Signals:**
- "O Romeo, Romeo" — noun of address, set off by punctuation
- Interjection "O" signals heightened emotion
**Effect on stance:** Intimacy, immediacy. Reader positioned as eavesdropper—we're overhearing private address. Vocative collapses distance.
**Classical kin:** Apostrophe (the trope), but vocative is the grammatical case itself.

### **Inversion (Archaic Word Order)**
**Lines:** L1
**Signals:**
- "wherefore art thou Romeo?" — verb-subject order (art thou) instead of modern subject-verb (you are)
- Question syntax with fronted interrogative ("wherefore")
**Effect on stance:** Archaic syntax places "Romeo" in final, stressed position. Reader's ear lands on the name—the problem itself. Inversion = emphasis.
**Classical kin:** Hyperbaton (transposed word order), but this is standard Early Modern English question formation.

### **Parallel Imperatives**
**Lines:** L2, L3
**Signals:**
- "Deny...refuse...be" — three imperative verbs structuring discourse
- Bare infinitive form (no "to")
**Effect on time/authority:** Present-tense urgency. Reader experiences commands as immediate, non-negotiable. But impossibility of commands (deny father, refuse name) undercuts authority—she has none.
**Classical kin:** Anaphora (scheme), but this is grammatical mood (imperative vs. indicative).

### **Modal Auxiliaries (Volition)**
**Lines:** L3, L4
**Signals:**
- "wilt" (archaic future/will) — "if thou wilt not"
- "I'll" (contraction of "I will")
**Effect on stance:** Modality shifts agency. "Wilt" = your choice; "I'll" = my promise. Reader hears negotiation, exchange of wills. But "will" as volition (not mere futurity) shows both determination and doubt.
**Classical kin:** Deliberative rhetoric (future action), but modal auxiliaries are grammatical—"will" vs. "shall," "wilt" vs. "would."

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** L1 opens with open vowel "O" (mouth wide, cry of invocation) → liquids in "Romeo" (r-m-r) smooth, incantatory → fricative "wherefore" (wh-f-r) → L2 plosives "Deny...father" (d-f) sharp, cutting → L3-4 softer: "sworn...love...longer...Capulet" (liquids, nasals). Sound moves from cry → command → compromise.

**Cadence seams:** Comma after each "Romeo" (L1) = breath, pause for emphasis. Semicolon after "name" (L2) = full stop before alternative. Comma after "not" (L3) = hinge. Comma after "love" (L3) = breath before consequence. Period after "Capulet" (L4) = finality.

**Alliteration:** "father...refuse" (f-r cluster, L2) — harsh fricatives. "Wilt...sworn" (w-s, L3) — softer. "Love...longer" (l, L3-4) — liquid continuity.

**Iambic pentameter:**
- L1: "O RO-me-O, RO-me-o, where-FORE art THOU Ro-ME-o?" (11 syllables, hypermetric; three stresses on "Romeo")
- L2: "de-NY thy FA-ther AND re-FUSE thy NAME" (perfect iambic pentameter)
- L3: "or IF thou WILT not BE but SWORN my LOVE" (iambic with variation)
- L4: "and I'LL no LONG-er BE a CAP-u-LET" (iambic with trochaic opening "AND i'll")

**Music argues:** Verse regularity (iambic pentameter) imposes order on emotional chaos. Rhythmic structure = attempted rational control.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Interrogative (L1: rhetorical question) | Imperative compound (L2: two commands coordinated) | Complex conditional (L3–4: "if...then" structure with subordinate + coordinate clauses).

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Mostly coordination (L2: "and"; L3: "or") with one subordinate conditional (L3: "if"). Effect: paratactic equality—alternatives presented as equivalent options, though they're both impossible.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Possessives (L2):** "thy father," "thy name" — both preposed, showing ownership/identity relation
- **Minimizer (L3):** "but" (= only, just) — "be but sworn my love" (downplays magnitude of request)
- **Negative adverb (L4):** "no longer" — temporal negation

**Inversion:** L1 question (verb-subject). Otherwise SVO.

**Information flow:** Address (Romeo) → problem (wherefore Romeo) → solution 1 (deny name) → solution 2 (if not, be sworn) → consequence (I'll deny mine).

### Micro-rewrites:

**Compressed:** *"Romeo, why are you Romeo? Reject your name, or swear you're mine and I'll reject mine."*
**Lost:** Epizeuxis ("Romeo, Romeo"), interjection "O," modal "wilt," minimizer "but," parallel structure. Gained: speed, but semantic density evaporates.

**Dilated:** *"O Romeo, my Romeo, why must you bear the name Romeo, which marks you as my family's sworn enemy? I beg you to deny your father's authority and refuse the name you were given at birth; or, if you are unwilling or unable to do so, then simply swear that you will be my love, and in return I promise that I will no longer identify myself as a member of the Capulet family."*
**Lost:** Economy, breath-rhythm, ambiguity of "wherefore," poetry. Gained: prose clarity that kills dramatic urgency.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** "Thou" / "thy" vs. "I" / "my" — intimate second-person (archaic "thou," not formal "you") establishes private sphere. Spatial deixis absent (she doesn't know Romeo's listening, doesn't say "here" or "there").

**Aspect:**
- "art" (L1) = stative, present (being Romeo, not becoming)
- "Deny," "refuse," "be" (L2-3) = imperative, atelic (unbounded commands—when? how? unspecified)
- "I'll...be" (L4) = future, stative (promised state change)

**Modality:**
- "wherefore art thou" (L1) = epistemic question (why does this naming exist?)
- "Deny...refuse" (L2) = deontic (obligation/command)
- "wilt" (L3) = volitional (your choice, your will)
- "I'll" (L4) = deontic/promissory (I commit to action)

**Quoted locus:** Entire passage = interior monologue externalized through apostrophe. No frame, no "she said"—pure character voice.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Naming/Identity:** "Romeo" (proper noun as prison), "thy name," "Capulet"
2. **Family/Authority:** "thy father" (patriarchal structure)
3. **Oath/Promise:** "sworn my love" (legal-religious binding)

**Lexical fields:**
- **Denial cluster:** "Deny," "refuse," "no longer be" (negation, renunciation)
- **Will cluster:** "wilt" (volition), "I'll" (determination)
- **Possession cluster:** "thy father," "thy name," "my love" (ownership and identity)

**Image logic in four lines:** Name = identity = family = obstacle to love. To love = to annihilate identity (yours or mine). No images of bodies, touches, physical world—entirely abstract (names, promises, family).

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Internal (Juliet's consciousness). Reader inhabits her perspective—we don't see Romeo yet, just the problem of his name as she conceives it.

**Time (Genette):**
- **Order:** Synchronous (now: "art thou"). No analepsis/prolepsis, though "I'll" projects future.
- **Duration:** Scene (4 lines performed in ~10 seconds = real-time utterance).
- **Frequency:** Singulative (this moment, this thought).

**Beat structure:** Invocation (L1) → demand 1 (L2) → alternative (L3) → reciprocal promise (L4).

**Subtext:** She's offering to destroy herself ("no longer be a Capulet") if he won't. Mutual annihilation as condition for union. Romeo's silence (from her perspective—she thinks she's alone) makes her speak for both of them.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Juliet = young, female, socially powerless. No authority to make demands. Imperatives ("Deny," "refuse") are desperate, not authoritative. Reader trusts her vulnerability, not her power.

**Pathos:** Emotional escalation: question (L1) → commands (L2) → compromise (L3) → self-sacrifice (L4). Reader feels mounting desperation. "No longer be a Capulet" = identity death for love.

**Logos:** Conditional logic (if/then), alternative structures (or), parallel exchanges (you give up name / I give up name). But logic applied to illogical premise (love requires identity annihilation). Reader sees rational form containing irrational content.

**Lines:** "if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet" = bargaining, negotiation grammar ("if X, then Y, and I'll Z"). Syntax performs equivalence, exchange, fairness—but the exchange is mutual destruction.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Ovid's *Metamorphoses*:** Identity transformation as love's condition (Pyramus & Thisbe—Shakespeare's source for R&J plot).

**Petrarchan sonnets:** Apostrophe to absent beloved, name-obsession, love as suffering.

**Marlowe's *Hero and Leander*:** Rhetorical question as erotic strategy, lovers thwarted by external obstacles.

**Subversion:** Juliet inverts Petrarchan convention—not male poet addressing silent female beloved, but female speaker commanding male beloved to transform. She's agent, not object.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots:
1. **"wherefore art thou Romeo?"** (L1) — Most misunderstood line in English literature. "Wherefore" = "why," not "where." Entire problem compressed: why must you be Montague? Why does naming determine fate?
2. **"Deny thy father and refuse thy name"** (L2) — Impossible demand. Father = patriarchy, family, identity, inheritance. To deny = social death, self-annihilation. "Refuse thy name" = undo your existence.
3. **"be but sworn my love"** (L3) — Minimizer "but" (only, just) tries to make cosmic commitment sound trivial. The understatement is the desperation.

### Faultlines:
1. **"if thou wilt not"** (L3) — "Wilt" = your choice. **Risk:** Frames male agency as sole variable. Juliet's offer ("I'll no longer be a Capulet") is automatic response, not simultaneous choice. **Fix:** "if we both renounce..." **Shift:** Gains equality, loses rhetorical structure (she's commanding, not negotiating).

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

### Subtraction test:
**Remove:** Epizeuxis ("Romeo, Romeo" → "O Romeo")
**Result:** "O Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?"
**Loss:** Incantatory obsession disappears. Name becomes question, not fixation. Single iteration = simple address; doubled = entrapment in naming itself.

### Amplification test:
**Heighten:** Add more alternatives
**Result:** "Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or change thy house, or flee thy city, or abandon all thy kin; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love..."
**Gain:** More options, more desperation. **Risk:** Dilutes focus. Original's stark either/or (deny name OR swear love) is stronger—binary trap, not buffet.

### Register shift (formal ↔ colloquial):
**Formal:** "Romeo, for what reason do you bear the name Romeo? I beseech you to repudiate your paternal lineage and renounce your surname."
**Effect:** Latinate abstraction kills intimacy. "Repudiate," "paternal lineage" = essay, not cry.

**Colloquial:** "Romeo, why are you a Romeo? Ditch your dad and drop the name; or if you won't, just say you'll be with me, and I'll stop being a Capulet."
**Effect:** "Ditch," "drop," "just say" = contemporary, but loses archaic formality that marks social structure (the very thing they're fighting). "Thou/thy" = intimacy within hierarchy; "you" = generic.

### Punctuation swap:
**Question mark → Period:** "O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo."
**Effect:** Becomes statement of fact, not question. Loses interrogative anguish. She'd be accepting, not questioning, fate.

**Semicolon → Period:** "Deny thy father and refuse thy name. Or, if thou wilt not..."
**Effect:** Harder break between options. Semicolon = two related options; period = two separate commands. Original's continuity is stronger—both options are one thought.

### Focalization nudge:
**Current:** Juliet's apostrophe (addressing Romeo)
**Shift to third-person narration:** "She wondered why he had to be Romeo. If only he would deny his father and refuse his name."
**Effect:** Loses immediacy, intimacy, dramatic irony (he's listening!). Apostrophe = performed interiority; narration = reported interiority.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

### Imitatio (new content, same scaffolding):
*O stranger, stranger, wherefore art thou stranger? Forget thy country and refuse thy tongue; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my friend, And I'll no longer be a citizen.*

**Replicates:** Epizeuxis (doubled name), rhetorical question ("wherefore"), parallel imperatives ("Forget...refuse"), conditional alternative ("if thou wilt not"), reciprocal promise ("I'll no longer"). Applies structure to immigrant/refugee identity crisis—language and nationality as barriers.

### Counter-Imitatio (same content, opposing scaffolding):
*I know you are Romeo. You must keep your father and claim your name proudly. There's no alternative—I insist you not swear anything to me. I will always be a Capulet, as you will always be a Montague.*

**Opposes:** Declarative statement replaces question, commands become acceptances, alternatives eliminated, conditional removed, reciprocal promise inverted (both keep identities). Swaps tragic yearning for resigned realism.

### Compression (≤20 words):
*Romeo, why Romeo? Deny your name, or swear you're mine and I'll deny mine.*

**Keeps:** Epizeuxis, rhetorical question, imperatives, conditional structure. Cuts: "O," "thy father," "but," "Capulet."

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. **Double the name when the name itself is the problem.** (epizeuxis makes naming a trap)
2. **Use imperatives for impossible commands—desperation as grammar.** (command what cannot be done)
3. **Deploy "but" as minimizer to downplay cosmic requests.** ("be but sworn" = make enormity sound trivial)
4. **Build conditional alternatives when both options are unacceptable.** (Either/Or structure exposes tragic bind)
5. **Match archaic syntax to social hierarchy under interrogation.** ("thou/thy" = intimacy within the very structure being challenged)
6. **Let rhetorical questions do philosophy's work.** ("wherefore" = not "where?" but "why does this have to be?")
7. **Mirror syntax to show reciprocal sacrifice.** ([you] deny name → [I] deny name = balanced exchange)
