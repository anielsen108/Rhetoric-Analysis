## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Analepsis** (an-uh-LEP-sis)
*Definition:* Flashback.
*Example:* Future moment recalls past from further past.
*Effect:* Creates three temporal layers in one sentence.

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Contrast between expectation and reality.
*Example:* Facing death recalls childhood wonder.
*Effect:* Juxtaposes mortal terror with innocent discovery.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement.
*Example:* "discover ice" for mundane object treated as marvel.
*Effect:* Makes familiar strange through historical perspective.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Temporal Frame
"Many years later"—**temporal phrase** without specific number. Syntax creates indefinite futurity.

### Temporal Subordinate
"as he faced the firing squad"—**temporal conjunction** with dramatic present. Syntax makes execution backdrop for memory.

### Nominal Subject
"Colonel Aureliano Buendía"—**full name with military title**. Syntax gives character formal introduction.

### Periphrastic Future
"was to remember"—**past tense auxiliary** with infinitive creating future-in-past. Syntax creates complex temporal perspective.

### Deictic Distance
"that distant afternoon"—**demonstrative** with adjective of remoteness. Syntax marks childhood as far removed.

### Temporal Subordinate
"when his father took him"—**temporal clause** embedding third time layer. Syntax nests past within past.

### Infinitive Purpose
"to discover ice"—**purpose infinitive** with mundane object. Syntax makes ordinary substance into exploration object.

### Stylistic Effect
Through indefinite many-years-later, subordinate firing-squad moment, formal full-name subject, periphrastic was-to-remember creating future-in-past, demonstrative distant-afternoon, nested when-clause embedding third temporal layer, and infinitive discover-ice making familiar strange, García Márquez creates syntax of magical realism—grammar that collapses linear time, making death and childhood simultaneous through memory, treating mundane ice as wondrous discovery.
