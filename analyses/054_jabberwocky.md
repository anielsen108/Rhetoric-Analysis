## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Neologism** (nee-AHL-oh-jiz-um)
*Definition:* Invented words.
*Example:* brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe.
*Effect:* Creates nonsense that somehow makes sense through syntax and sound.

### **Portmanteau** (port-man-TOH)
*Definition:* Word blending two words.
*Example:* "slithy" (slimy + lithe); "mimsy" (miserable + flimsy).
*Effect:* Creates semantic compression; new words that suggest meanings.

### **Onomatopoeia** (on-uh-mat-uh-PEE-uh)
*Definition:* Words that sound like what they mean.
*Example:* "gyre," "gimble," "outgrabe"—sound suggests motion/sound.
*Effect:* Makes nonsense words feel meaningful through sound.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Archaic Contraction
"'Twas brillig"—the **contraction "'Twas"** (It was) creates archaic, poetic tone. The syntax immediately signals: this is formal verse, not prose.

The **predicate adjective "brillig"** is nonsense, but the syntax is standard: It was [adjective]. The grammatical normality makes the lexical nonsense acceptable.

### Coordinate Clause
"and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble"—the **coordinating conjunction** links two independent clauses about the time/setting. The syntax is conventional even as vocabulary is invented.

### Emphatic "Did"
"Did gyre and gimble"—the **auxiliary "did"** + infinitive creates emphasis (they DID gyre and gimble). The syntax is archaic/poetic, adding weight to nonsense verbs.

### Prepositional Phrase
"in the wabe"—the **locative prepositional phrase** situates the action spatially. The syntax treats "wabe" as if it's a known location.

### Inverted Syntax
"All mimsy were the borogoves"—**predicate adjective "mimsy" fronted** before subject and verb: "were the borogoves." Normal order would be "the borogoves were all mimsy." This inversion is poetic, formal, emphasizing "mimsy."

### Coordinate Final Clause
"And the mome raths outgrabe"—simple **subject-verb** with modifier "mome" before "raths." The verb "outgrabe" (past tense by context and -ed sound) ends the stanza.

### Grammatical Coherence
The stanza uses **perfect English syntax**:
- Copulative sentences (It was X; X were Y)
- Action sentences with prepositional phrases (did X in Y)
- Modifiers before nouns (slithy toves, mome raths)
- Proper verb forms (past tense throughout)

The **grammatical correctness** makes the lexical nonsense work. We understand the syntax even if we don't know the words.

### Sound Patterns
The words follow **English phonotactics** (sound rules). "Slithy" SOUNDS like it could be English. "Brillig" feels like a real word. The syntax includes sound patterning that makes invented words feel natural.

### Stylistic Effect
Through perfect syntax filled with invented vocabulary, Carroll creates his famous nonsense verse. The form IS the meaning: standard grammatical structures prove language is partly syntax, partly sound, and semantics can be negotiated. We understand the passage because we understand English syntax, even without knowing the words. This is Tufte's principle taken to extreme: syntax AS meaning—the grammatical structures carry so much information that lexical content becomes almost optional. Grammar itself tells us: something was slithy, it did actions, in a place. The syntax makes nonsense comprehensible.
