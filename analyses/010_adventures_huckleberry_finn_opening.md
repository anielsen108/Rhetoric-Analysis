# Passage 010: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn Opening

**Mark Twain** · *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* · 1884 | Chapter 1

**Occasion/Pressure:** American novel's threshold; narrator must establish authentic vernacular voice while breaking fictional frame—speaking truth that novel-writing is lying.
**Persona/Stance:** Unschooled boy narrator performing casualness; syntactically "incorrect" but morally reliable, offering honesty through grammatical transgression.
**Thesis of Effect:** Syntax weaponizes dialect, making "errors" (double negatives, non-standard constructions) the vehicle of truth—form democratizes American literature by validating vernacular as literary language.

## PASSAGE

[L1] You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures
[L2] of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and
[L3] he told the truth, mainly.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Metalepsis** (met-uh-LEP-sis / ˌmɛtəˈlɛpsɪs)
**Lines:** L2–3
**Definition:** Reference crossing narrative levels; character aware of author/fiction.
**Evidence:** "That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain"—Huck names his creator, breaking frame.
**Effect:** Demolishes fourth wall; reader must hold two realities (Huck as character, Huck as Twain's invention). Fiction admits its fictionality, paradoxically increasing authenticity of voice.
**Near-miss:** Not mere allusion (reference within same level): metalepsis *crosses* ontological boundaries—character addressing author.

### **Litotes** (LIE-tuh-teez / ˈlaɪtəˌtiz)
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Understatement via negative construction.
**Evidence:** "that ain't no matter"—dismissing as unimportant via negation.
**Effect:** Casual shrug in syntax; Huck signals he doesn't care about prerequisite knowledge. Reader hears boy's voice, not authorial authority.
**Near-miss:** Not meiosis (simple understatement): litotes specifically uses *negative* phrasing ("ain't no" not "it's unimportant").

### **Parrhesia** (puh-REE-zhuh / pəˈriːziə)
**Lines:** L3
**Definition:** Frank, candid speech; speaking truth to power.
**Evidence:** "he told the truth, mainly"—qualifying Twain's honesty with brutal "mainly."
**Effect:** Reader trusts narrator who admits even his creator lies *sometimes*. The hedged praise becomes deeper truth-telling than absolute endorsement.
**Near-miss:** Not just irony: parrhesia is *ethical* stance, privileging honesty over politeness.

### **Apophasis** (uh-PAH-fuh-sis / əˈpɒfəsɪs) [mild form]
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Mentioning by claiming not to mention.
**Evidence:** "You don't know...but that ain't no matter"—raises prior book while dismissing its importance.
**Effect:** Huck pretends not to care (independence), but by mentioning it, ensures reader knows backstory exists. The dismissal is the advertisement.
**Near-miss:** Not full apophasis (which loudly denies while describing): Huck's version is subtler.

### **Qualification** (kwahl-ih-fih-KAY-shun / ˌkwɒlɪfɪˈkeɪʃən)
**Lines:** L3
**Definition:** Limiting or modifying a statement.
**Evidence:** "told the truth, mainly"—adverb "mainly" undermines verb "told the truth."
**Effect:** Reader laughs at the delayed undercut. Syntax gives with left hand ("truth"), takes with right ("mainly"). Form enacts Huck's skeptical intelligence.
**Near-miss:** Not equivocation (avoiding commitment): qualification *commits* to nuanced position.

### **Direct Address** (duh-REKT uh-DRES / dɪˈrɛkt əˈdrɛs)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Speaking to reader as "you."
**Evidence:** "You don't know about me"—second person establishes conversational intimacy.
**Effect:** Reader pulled into narrative as interlocutor, not observer. Syntax refuses novelistic distance; we're in the room with Huck.
**Near-miss:** Not apostrophe (addressing absent/abstract entity): Huck addresses present, specific reader.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Solecism** (SAH-leh-siz-um / ˈsɒləsɪzəm)
**Lines:** L1 ("without you have read"), L2 ("ain't no")
**Definition:** Deliberate grammatical deviation.
**Evidence:** "without you have read" (non-standard conditional); "ain't no matter" (double negative).
**Effect:** Syntax authenticates voice through "error." Reader recognizes Missouri dialect, social class, lack of formal education—all via grammar choices. The mistakes *are* the characterization.
**Risk:** Could alienate educated readers. Twain's genius: makes "incorrect" syntax more vivid than standard.

### **Parataxis** (pair-uh-TAK-sis / ˌpærəˈtæksɪs)
**Lines:** L1–3
**Definition:** Coordination without hierarchical subordination.
**Evidence:** "You don't know...but that ain't no matter. That book was made...and he told the truth."—Simple clauses joined by "but" and "and," no complex embedding.
**Effect:** Syntax mirrors thought process of intelligent but unschooled mind. Reader experiences simplicity that carries complex irony.
**Risk:** Can seem simplistic. Here, the plainness is strategic—Huck's clarity cuts through adult pretension.

### **Parallelism** (PAIR-uh-lel-iz-um / ˈpærəˌlɛlɪzəm) [loose]
**Lines:** L1–2
**Definition:** Similar grammatical structures.
**Evidence:** "You don't know...without you have read" // "that ain't no matter"—both use negative constructions (don't, ain't no).
**Effect:** Repetition of negatives establishes Huck's stance: defining himself by what he's NOT, what doesn't matter. Reader hears persistent negation as world-weariness.
**Risk:** Parallelism is loose here; reader may not consciously notice.

### **Ellipsis** (ih-LIP-sis / ɪˈlɪpsɪs)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Omission of expected words.
**Evidence:** "a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"—omits "called" or "named." Also: "You don't know about me" omits "anything" (about me).
**Effect:** Creates conversational compression. Reader fills gaps naturally, experiencing speech rather than formal prose.
**Risk:** Can create ambiguity. Here, context makes meaning clear.

### **Metabasis** (meh-TAB-uh-sis / məˈtæbəsɪs)
**Lines:** L2 ("but")
**Definition:** Brief statement of what has been said and what will follow.
**Evidence:** "but that ain't no matter"—transitional phrase dismissing prior topic, pivoting forward.
**Effect:** Syntax performs conversational pivot: was talking about prior book, now moving on. Reader experiences Huck's mind in motion.
**Risk:** Can feel abrupt. Here, the abruptness IS Huck's personality.

### **Dialysis** (dy-AL-ih-sis / daɪˈæləsɪs)
**Lines:** L2–3
**Definition:** Presenting several arguments/points without connecting them hierarchically.
**Evidence:** "That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain" (fact 1), "and he told the truth, mainly" (fact 2)—coordinate facts without subordination.
**Effect:** Huck lists observations without analysis; reader does interpretive work. Syntax refuses to editorialize.
**Risk:** Can seem underdeveloped. Twain trusts reader to catch the irony Huck doesn't flag.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Vernacular Syntax / Dialectal Grammar**
**Lines:** L1–2
**Signals:**
- "without you have read" (non-standard conditional; standard = "unless you have read").
- "ain't no matter" (double negative; standard = "isn't any matter" or "is no matter").
- "a book by the name of" (dialectal periphrasis; standard = "a book called/named").
**Effect on stance:** Syntax authenticates Huck's voice as uneducated Missouri boy, 1840s. Reader trusts voice's honesty *because* of grammatical "errors"—authenticity through non-standard form.
**Classical kin:** Solecism (deliberate error), but modern analysis sees dialect as *system*, not mistake.

### **Metaleptic Frame-Breaking**
**Lines:** L2–3
**Signals:**
- Character refers to self in prior fiction: "a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."
- Character names author: "made by Mr. Mark Twain."
- Third-person distance ("That book") from self.
**Effect on stance:** Syntax destabilizes fiction/reality boundary. Reader must navigate: Huck is fictional (Twain created him) yet speaks as if real (names Twain as separate person). The grammatical impossibility becomes postmodern truth-telling.
**Classical kin:** Metalepsis (trope), but modern narratology (Genette) analyzes as ontological transgression.

### **Free Direct Discourse / Conversational Syntax**
**Lines:** L1–3
**Signals:**
- Direct address ("You").
- Present-oriented deixis ("You don't know"—not "the reader will not know").
- Informal contractions ("don't," "ain't").
- Colloquialisms ("that ain't no matter," "mainly").
**Effect on stance:** Syntax performs oral storytelling. Reader "hears" Huck speaking directly, not through narrative filter. Form collapses distance between utterance-time and reading-time.
**Classical kin:** Sermocinatio (speech-in-character), but Twain's innovation is making entire novel this immediate.

### **Qualification / Adverbial Hedging**
**Lines:** L3
**Signals:**
- "told the truth, mainly"—adverb "mainly" modifies and undercuts verb phrase.
- Comma before "mainly" creates pause, emphasizing qualification.
**Effect on stance:** Syntax embeds skepticism in assertion. Reader learns to trust Huck's qualified judgments more than absolute claims. Form teaches epistemological modesty.
**Classical kin:** Litotes/meiosis, but modernly analyzed as modal hedging (linguistic pragmatics).

### **Negative-Heavy Syntax**
**Lines:** L1–2
**Signals:**
- "don't know" (negation).
- "without you have" (negative conditional).
- "ain't no matter" (double negative).
**Effect on stance:** Syntax defines by absence/negation rather than presence/assertion. Huck establishes who he is by what he ISN'T, what DOESN'T matter. Reader experiences adolescent negative identity-formation.
**Classical kin:** Apophasis (denial), but here serving characterological depth.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Predominantly monosyllabic: "You don't know about me" (5 of 6 words one syllable); "but that ain't no matter" (6 of 6). Tongue barely moves—casual, drawled American speech. Polysyllabic exceptions stand out: "Adventures" (3), "mainly" (2)—formal words in informal syntax, creating tonal friction.

**Cadence seams:** Natural speech rhythm, not metrical. "You DON'T know aBOUT me withOUT you have READ a BOOK..."—stresses land on content words (don't, know, me, without, read, book), function words unstressed. The rhythm is prose rhythm, but specifically *spoken* prose.

**Alliteration:** Minimal, not ornamental. "made...Mark" (L2–3, /m/ plosive), "told the truth" (L3, /t/ plosive)—incidental, not designed. The lack of poetic device IS the poetic device—Huck doesn't perform literariness.

**Caesura:** L2: "but that ain't no matter. || That book was made..."—period-stop (full caesura) separates dismissal from new information. Breath-pause resets topic. L3: "told the truth, || mainly."—comma-pause before devastating qualification. The timing is comedic: reader trusts, then pause, then undercut.

**Meter signature:** None. Deliberately un-metered. The anti-poetic stance is political: Twain rejects genteel tradition's formal metrics for democratic American speech-prose.

**Music argues:** The ear hears honesty in plainness. Monosyllabic bluntness = truth-telling; polysyllabic formality ("Adventures of Tom Sawyer," "Mr. Mark Twain") = adult world's pretension. Sound structure enacts Huck's divided consciousness: speaking plain truth about fancy lies.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Loose cumulative structures. Sentence 1: Core ("You don't know about me") + condition ("without you have read...") + elaboration ("by the name of..."); continues adding rightward. Sentence 2: Simple declarative ("that ain't no matter"). Sentence 3: Core ("That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain") + coordinate addition ("and he told the truth, mainly"). No periodic suspension; all cumulative ease.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** High coordination, minimal subordination. "but" and "and" dominate; only one subordinate construction ("without you have read") in three sentences. Effect: Paratactic simplicity mirrors Huck's thought—one thing, then another, linked by "and"/"but," not hierarchized by "because"/"although."

**Modification choreography:**
- **Postposed:** "a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"—noun + long prepositional modifier.
- **Embedded:** None complex.
- **Parallel:** "was made...and he told"—coordinate verbs, simple past.

**Inversion:** None. Subject-verb-object throughout. Huck speaks in natural English order, refusing Latinate or poetic inversion.

**Information flow:** Given (L1): You need context (prior book). New (L2): But you don't. Given (L2): Twain wrote it. New (L3): He mostly told truth. Each sentence adds one new piece, accumulating without complexity.

### Micro-rewrites:

**Compressed:** *"You might not know me unless you read Tom Sawyer. Doesn't matter. Twain wrote that, mostly truthfully."*
**Lost:** Dialectal syntax ("without," "ain't no"), metaleptic distance ("That book," "Mr. Mark Twain"), the qualification's devastating pause ("mainly"). Standard grammar flattens Huck's voice into educated narrator. Current version's "errors" ARE the artistry.

**Dilated:** *"You probably don't know anything about me, that is, unless you have previously read a book that goes by the name and title of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't really no matter at all, because that book, which was written and made by Mr. Mark Twain, told the truth for the most part, or mainly, though not entirely without some stretchers here and there."*
**Lost:** Compression, punch, the perfect timing of "mainly." Dilution buries the knife. Current version's brevity is precision—every word earns its place.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Present conversation between Huck (speaker) and "You" (reader). "You don't know" = present tense, present addressee. But past reference: "have read" (perfect aspect—past action relevant to present). Huck stands in narrative-now, looking back at prior book, addressing immediate reader.

**Aspect:**
- "don't know" (L1): Simple present (stative knowledge—ongoing state).
- "have read" (L1): Present perfect (past action with present relevance—if you read it before, you know now).
- "ain't" (L2): Present tense negative copula (ongoing state of not-mattering).
- "was made" (L2): Simple past passive (completed action—book's creation finished).
- "told" (L3): Simple past (completed action—Twain's truth-telling in that book).

**Modality:**
- "without you have read" (L1): Conditional modality—hypothetical (if-not).
- Epistemic modality absent: No "maybe," "might," "probably"—Huck speaks with confidence.
- "mainly" (L3): Modal adverb qualifying certainty—not "all truth," but "mostly truth."

**Quoted locus:** "he told the truth, mainly" (L3)—adverb "mainly" is load-bearing. It's not emphatic ("he truly told the truth") but limitative ("he told truth...mostly"). Modal force: reduces certainty from 100% to ~80%. Reader trusts the honesty of the reduction.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Fabrication/Construction:** "book was made"—normally "written," but "made" suggests craft/manufacture, possibly falsehood (made up).
2. **Knowledge/Ignorance:** "know about me" / "don't know"—reader positioned as lacking information Huck possesses.

**Lexical fields:**
- **Textual/Literary:** "book," "read," "Adventures," "made," "Mr. Mark Twain"—discourse of authorship and fiction.
- **Epistemology:** "know," "truth," "matter" (or not)—discourse of knowledge and truth-value.
- **Negation:** "don't," "without," "ain't no"—pervasive negative constructions frame the opening.

**Image logic in three sentences:** You lack knowledge (of me) unless you have textual knowledge (prior book), but that absence doesn't matter because texts are partially true ("mainly"). The logic: direct knowledge (conversation with Huck) > mediated knowledge (reading book) > and even mediated knowledge is compromised (truth + lies). Epistemological hierarchy: present voice > past text > truth is always qualified.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Homodiegetic narrator (Genette)—Huck narrates his own story. But metalepsis complicates: when Huck refers to "Mr. Mark Twain," he momentarily occupies extradiegetic position (character aware of author). Psychic distance: Minimal—reader inside Huck's consciousness from word one.

**Time (Genette):**
- **Order:** Present narration (you don't know) referring to past text (Tom Sawyer) and its past creation (was made, told truth). Complex temporal layering in three sentences.
- **Duration:** Opening pause before narrative proper—scene zero, threshold moment.
- **Frequency:** Singulative (one telling of unique opening).

**Beat structure:** Huck establishes (1) potential ignorance, (2) dismisses it, (3) undermines prior text's reliability. Reader learns: Huck is honest, skeptical, doesn't care about conventional narrative prerequisites. Character established in 50 words.

**Subtext:** What's unspoken? Huck's ambivalence about being in a book at all. He dismisses Tom Sawyer ("ain't no matter") possibly because he resents being characterized, shaped by author. The metalepsis hints at character's desire for autonomy from creator.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Built through voice authenticity. Grammatical "errors" prove Huck isn't performed by educated author—he's "real" (within fiction's frame). Qualifying Twain's truth-telling establishes credibility: narrator who admits even his creator lies sometimes is narrator we trust absolutely.

**Pathos:** Minimal emotional appeal; affect is understated casualness. "that ain't no matter"—shrug, not plea. Strategy: withhold emotion to avoid manipulation. Reader trusts the restraint.

**Logos:** Implicit argument: (1) Prior knowledge may be incomplete; (2) incompleteness doesn't matter; (3) all tellings are partial truths. Logical through-line: skepticism about textual authority, privileging present conversation over past text.

**Lines:** "he told the truth, mainly" (L3)—adverb "mainly" is the logical hedge. Not "somewhat" (too weak) or "often" (too vague), but "mainly" (most of the time, but not always). Precision in qualification = rhetorical control.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Southwestern humor tradition (Johnson Hooper, George Washington Harris):** Vernacular narrators, dialect humor, frame-tale structures. Twain inherits but perfects: makes dialect-speaker the primary narrator, not comic foil framed by educated voice.

**Cervantes (*Don Quixote*):** Metaleptic play with authorship (Cide Hamete Benengeli); characters aware they're in books. Twain adapts metafictional play for American democratic context—boy narrator, not Spanish hidalgo.

**Defoe (*Moll Flanders*, *Crusoe*):** First-person picaresque confessionals. Huck's direct address and conversational tone inherit from 18th-century realism, but dialect is Twain's innovation.

**Whitman (*Leaves of Grass*):** Democratic American voice, colloquial syntax, "I" addressing "you." Twain novelizes Whitman's poetic project—making vernacular the literary standard.

**Subversion:** Where prior tradition frames dialect-speakers within standard-English narration (showing they're "other"), Twain makes dialect-speaker the sole narrative authority. The "incorrect" syntax becomes the correct literary language. Revolutionary form: democratizing not just content but grammar itself.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots:
1. **"without you have read"** (L1) — Non-standard conditional. Standard would be "unless" or "if you haven't." Grammatical deviation establishes Huck's voice in first six words—reader knows immediately this is dialect narrator.
2. **"ain't no matter"** (L2) — Double negative (stigmatized in standard English, common in dialects). The "error" is the ethos—proves Huck is who he claims to be (unschooled river boy).
3. **"That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain"** (L2–3) — "made" (not "written") + "Mr." (formal) + metalepsis (character naming creator). Huck distances himself ("that book," not "my book") while treating Twain with suspicious formality ("Mr."). Syntax performs ambivalence.
4. **"mainly"** (L3) — One-word devastation. Qualifies entire prior claim. The comma-pause before it makes reader wait for the knife. Comedic timing perfect.

### Faultlines:
1. **"You don't know about me"** (L1) — "about me" could be "who I am" (more idiomatic). **Fix:** "You don't know me." **Shift:** More direct, loses the slightly awkward prepositional phrasing that characterizes Huck's speech. Current version's slight awkwardness IS authentic—people speak with prepositions.
2. **"a book by the name of"** (L1–2) — Wordy periphrasis. **Fix:** "a book called" or "a book named." **Shift:** More efficient, but loses Huck's attempt at formality (trying to sound proper when naming books). The circumlocution reveals character—boy imitating adult speech.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

### Subtraction test:
**Remove:** "but that ain't no matter" (L2)
**Result:** "You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain..."
**Loss:** The shrug, the dismissal, the signal that Huck doesn't care about prerequisites. Without it, passage suggests you MUST know Tom Sawyer—becomes conventional sequel opening. Current version's independence requires the dismissal.

### Amplification test:
**Heighten:** Add more qualification
**Result:** "he told the truth, mainly, though there were some stretchers in there, as there always are in books."
**Gain:** More explicit about "stretchers" (lies), Huck's voice extended. **Risk:** Over-explains. Current version's "mainly" trusts reader to infer the lies without spelling them out. More is less.

### Register shift (formal ↔ colloquial):
**Formal:** "You are likely unfamiliar with my circumstances unless you have previously read a volume entitled The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; however, that lack of knowledge is immaterial. Said volume was authored by Mr. Mark Twain, and he rendered the truth for the most part."
**Effect:** Bathetic. Educated syntax kills Huck's voice entirely. The formality is exactly what Twain rejects—Huck's "errors" are his truth-telling power. Standard English would be literary death.

**More colloquial:** "You don't know me unless you read Tom Sawyer. But whatever. Twain wrote it. Mostly true."
**Effect:** Too compressed; loses rhythm, loses "mainly"'s perfect placement. Current version is already colloquial—further compression strips nuance.

### Punctuation swap:
**Semicolon for period:** "You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter."
**Effect:** Links two independent clauses into one sentence. Gains flow, loses the full-stop dismissal. Period makes "that ain't no matter" a separate sentence—emphasizes the shrug. Current punctuation is better.

**Dash for comma:** "he told the truth—mainly."
**Effect:** Dash adds dramatic pause, making "mainly" more emphatic/comedic. Gains punch, but risks over-theatricality. Comma is subtler—lets "mainly" arrive quietly, which is funnier (understatement).

### Focalization nudge:
**Current:** Huck addressing reader directly.
**Third-person narration:** "Readers probably didn't know about Huck unless they'd read Tom Sawyer, but that didn't matter. Twain had written that book, and he'd told the truth, mainly."
**Effect:** Destroys everything. Voice gone, immediacy gone, metalepsis gone. Entire point of the novel—authentic first-person vernacular—erased. Demonstrates that Huck's syntax IS the novel's achievement.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

### Imitatio (new content, same scaffolding):
*You don't know about me without you been to college; but that ain't no matter. That degree was earned by me, mostly, and I learned some things, sort of.*

**Replicates:** Direct address ("You don't know"), non-standard conditional ("without you been"), dismissal ("ain't no matter"), qualification ("mostly," "sort of"), simple coordinate syntax, self-deprecating qualification of accomplishment.

### Counter-Imitatio (same content, opposing scaffolding):
*Dear Reader, permit me to introduce myself, assuming you have not previously made my acquaintance through the pages of that earlier volume, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer—though I hasten to add that such prior knowledge is by no means requisite to comprehension of the present narrative. That aforementioned work, composed by the esteemed author Mr. Mark Twain, hewed to factual accuracy with only minor deviations.*

**Opposes:** Formal salutation replaces direct address; subordination replaces parataxis; Latinate diction replaces monosyllables; complex periodic structure replaces simple cumulative; "minor deviations" replaces "mainly" (euphemistic instead of blunt).

### Compression (≤25 words):
*You don't know me unless you read Tom Sawyer. Doesn't matter. Twain wrote it, mostly truthfully.*

**Keeps:** Direct address, metalepsis, qualification. **Loses:** Dialectal syntax ("without," "ain't no"), "Mr." formality, "made" (not "wrote"), perfect timing of "mainly" placement. Compression sacrifices voice for brevity.

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. **Establish voice through grammatical "error"; make dialect the authority.** (Solecism as authenticity)
2. **Use direct address to collapse narrative distance; make reader present.** ("You" not "the reader")
3. **Deploy qualification to deepen trust; admit partial truth.** ("mainly"—honesty about limits)
4. **Break fictional frame to paradoxically increase authenticity.** (Metalepsis—admitting fiction makes character real)
5. **Let parataxis mirror unschooled intelligence; simplicity ≠ simplistic.** (Coordinate "and"/"but," no complex subordination)
6. **Place devastating qualification after pause; comma-timing is comedy.** ("told the truth, || mainly")
7. **Use negative constructions to define by absence; say what doesn't matter.** ("don't know," "ain't no," "without")
