## Author and Source
**William Shakespeare**, *The Merchant of Venice* (c. 1597), Act 3, Scene 1

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "Hath not a Jew..."; "If you...do we not..."
*Effect:* Creates insistent rhythm; hammers home shared humanity.

### **Rhetorical Question** (rih-TOR-ih-kul KWES-chun)
*Definition:* Question asked for effect, not answer.
*Example:* All questions—answer is obviously "yes."
*Effect:* Forces acknowledgment of common humanity.

### **Climax** (KLY-maks)
*Definition:* Arrangement from least to most intense.
*Example:* From physical (eyes, hands) to emotional (passions) to life/death.
*Effect:* Builds argument's emotional and logical power.

### **Parallelism** (par-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structures.
*Example:* All sentences follow identical pattern.
*Effect:* Creates powerful rhetorical rhythm.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Archaic Inverted Question
"Hath not a Jew eyes?"—**auxiliary verb "Hath"** (has) before subject creates question through inversion. This is Early Modern English interrogative syntax.

The **negative "not"** makes this negative question expecting positive answer. The syntax through negative question is more forceful than positive statement.

### Subject Placement
"a Jew" as subject—not "I" or "we" but "a Jew" (generic, representative). The syntax makes this about the group, not individual.

### List Accumulation
"hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions"—**asyndetic list** (no conjunctions) of increasingly abstract qualities. The syntax moves from concrete (hands) to abstract (passions).

### Conditional Parallel Questions
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?"—**conditional clause** + **rhetorical question**. This pattern repeats three times with rising stakes:
- prick → bleed (physical)
- tickle → laugh (emotional/social)
- poison → die (mortal)

### Pronoun Shift
Shifts from "a Jew" (third person) to "us/we" (first person plural). The syntax makes Shylock both representative and personal.

### Negative Questions
All use **"do we not"** construction—negative questions expecting affirmative answers. The syntax forces agreement through question form.

### Stylistic Effect
Through anaphoric rhetorical questions, conditional parallelism, and climactic arrangement, Shakespeare creates one of drama's most powerful speeches about human equality. The syntax performs the argument: identical grammatical structures assert identical humanity. Form IS the plea—grammar that insists through repetition that difference is superficial, sameness fundamental.
