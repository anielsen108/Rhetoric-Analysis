# Passage 179: "The Stone Diaries"

## Author and Source
**Carol Shields**, *The Stone Diaries* (1993)

## Passage
> My mother's name was Mercy Stone Goodwill. She was only thirty years old when she took sick, a boiling hot day, standing there in her back kitchen, making a Malvern pudding for her husband's supper.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "took sick" for sudden fatal illness.
*Effect:* Uses colloquial understatement for tragedy.

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Contrast between expectation and reality.
*Example:* Name "Mercy" for woman who receives none.
*Effect:* Makes victim's name darkly appropriate.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Associated term for thing.
*Example:* "back kitchen" for domestic sphere.
*Effect:* Locates death in space of women's labor.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Possessive Introduction
"My mother's name was"—**possessive with copula**. Syntax introduces through naming.

### Triple-Barreled Name
"Mercy Stone Goodwill"—**three names without commas**. Syntax gives complete formal identity.

### Quantified Age
"only thirty years old"—**restrictive adverb** with age. Syntax emphasizes youth through limitation.

### Temporal Subordinate
"when she took sick"—**temporal clause** with colloquial verb phrase. Syntax marks fatal moment.

### Appositive Day
"a boiling hot day"—**appositive phrase** with intensified adjective. Syntax adds atmospheric detail.

### Participial Location
"standing there in her back kitchen"—**present participle** with deictic and spatial. Syntax freezes mother in place.

### Participial Action
"making a Malvern pudding"—**present participle** with specific dish. Syntax shows what she was doing.

### Benefactive Purpose
"for her husband's supper"—**prepositional phrase** with possessive. Syntax makes cooking for husband the context of death.

### Stylistic Effect
Through possessive naming, restrictive only-thirty quantification, colloquial took-sick euphemism, appositive boiling-hot-day atmosphere, participial standing-there freezing, specific Malvern-pudding-making domesticity, and benefactive for-husband's-supper purpose, Shields creates syntax of domestic tragedy—grammar that locates mother's death precisely in space, time, and gendered labor, making fatal illness coincide with meal preparation for husband.
