## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Sibilants in "screaming" and "sky" hiss like incoming rocket.

**Cadence:** First sentence abrupt; second sentence expands then snaps shut with "now."

**Music:** Drumbeat of doom—two declaratives like warning sirens.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Simple clause followed by compound sentence with adversative conjunction.

**Modification:** Minimal; only essential prepositional phrase.

**Information flow:** Phenomenon appears → narrator contextualizes history yet confesses inadequacy.

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"A scream crosses the sky. It's happened before, but nothing compares now."* — Loses eeriness.
- **Dilated:** *"Across the sky there comes a screaming; it has come before, yet there is no measuring it now."* — Preserves gravity with archaic tone.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deixis:** "the sky" universal; no specific location anchors event.

**Aspect:** Present progressive aura; perfect aspect acknowledges history.

**Modality:** None; certainty asserted, comparison denied.

**Temporal logic:** Past repetition collapses into singular present moment.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Sound as object** crossing sky.
2. **Unnamable experience** resistant to analogy.

**Lexical fields:** Perception, comparison, time.

**Image logic:** Postmodern war defies description; only screaming remains.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Cosmic narrator perceiving rocket before characters do.

**Time:** Opening freeze-frame before novel scatters across timelines.

**Beat structure:** Sound arrives → narrator situates history → present danger underlined.

**Subtext:** Industrialized violence has become routine yet still annihilating.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Authorial omniscience evokes confidence in describing war machinery.

**Pathos:** Fear triggered by unstoppable projectile.

**Logos:** Logical paradox persuades reader of experiential void—no comparison possible.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Modernist fragmentation:** Echoes T.S. Eliot’s wartime disorientation.

**Apocalyptic sci-fi:** Shares kinship with Ballard’s technological dread.

**Mythic invocation:** Recalls epic proems, but for rocket age.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"A screaming"** — startling nominalization.
2. **"has happened before"** — situates cyclical terror.
3. **"nothing to compare"** — signals incomprehensibility.

### Faultlines
- Memory of previous attacks cannot guide survival now.
- Language itself strains to contain wartime trauma.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove sentence two—lose paradox that defines rocket’s uncanny status.

**Amplification test:** Add descriptive adjectives—risks dulling blunt terror with purple prose.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"An ululation traverses the heavens. Though precedent exists, no contemporary analogue suffices."*
- **Colloquial:** *"There’s that scream in the sky again, but nothing now feels the same."*

**Punctuation swap:** Replace period after L1 with ellipsis—softens impact, less alarm.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *A keening rolls over the harbor. It’s come before, yet nothing now matches it.*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *Noise crosses the sky. It happened before.* — Lacks tension and paradox.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *A screaming streaks overhead. It has happened before, yet nothing compares now.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Lead with verbing noun to foreground phenomenon over object.
2. Follow familiar assertion with negating clause to generate unease.
3. Keep diction elemental to magnify dread.
4. Use present tense for immediacy, perfect aspect for history.
5. Let absence of referent (no rocket named) heighten suspense.
6. Deploy paradox to suggest trauma exceeds language.
7. Close with "now" to pin terror to reader’s present.
