## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to non-human.
*Example:* "A screaming comes"
*Effect:* Makes V-2 rocket's sound an agent, autonomous terror.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Seemingly contradictory statement.
*Example:* "It has happened before, but there is nothing to compare it to"
*Effect:* Suggests unprecedented horror despite repetition.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "nothing to compare it to"
*Effect:* Understates incomparability of rocket attack.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Gerund as Subject
"A screaming comes"—**gerund** (verbal noun) as subject with present tense verb. Syntax makes sound itself the actor, not rocket.

### Spatial Preposition
"across the sky"—**prepositional phrase** of motion. Syntax tracks projectile's path through syntactic movement.

### Present Perfect
"It has happened before"—**present perfect** connects past occurrences to present moment. Syntax acknowledges repetition.

### Adversative But
"but there is nothing to compare"—**coordinating conjunction** creates opposition. Syntax contradicts the precedent just established.

### Infinitive Purpose
"to compare it to"—**infinitive phrase** with dangling preposition. Syntax leaves comparison incomplete, unresolved.

### Temporal Now
"now"—**temporal adverb** at end emphasizes present moment as unique despite repetition. Syntax makes this occurrence singular.

### Stylistic Effect
Through gerund personification, paradoxical conjunction (happened before BUT incomparable), and emphatic temporal "now," Pynchon creates syntax of technological sublime—grammar that captures unprecedented horror of modern warfare.
