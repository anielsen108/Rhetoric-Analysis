## Author and Source
**James Joyce**, *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* (1916)

## Passage
> Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "coming down along the road...coming down along the road"
*Effect:* Mimics child's repetitive speech patterns.

### **Polysyndeton** (pah-lee-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Many conjunctions.
*Example:* "and...and this moocow that was..."
*Effect:* Creates breathless, run-on quality of children's storytelling.

### **Neologism** (nee-AH-luh-jiz-um)
*Definition:* Invented words.
*Example:* "moocow," "nicens," "baby tuckoo"
*Effect:* Renders adult language through child's phonetic understanding.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Fairy Tale Formula
"Once upon a time and a very good time it was"—**formulaic opening** with additive clause. Syntax invokes oral storytelling tradition.

### Existential There
"there was a moocow"—**existential construction**. Syntax introduces character into story world.

### Present Participle
"coming down along the road"—**progressive aspect**. Syntax shows ongoing action from child's perspective.

### Relative Clause Repetition
"this moocow that was coming down along the road"—**restrictive relative clause** repeating earlier phrase. Syntax performs child's redundant retelling.

### Past Tense Narrative
"met a nicens little boy"—**simple past**. Syntax shifts to completed action of fairy tale.

### Participial Name
"named baby tuckoo"—**past participle** introducing character. Syntax makes naming part of character's definition.

### Compound Phonetics
"moocow," "nicens," "tuckoo"—**phonetic spelling**. Syntax represents pre-literate language acquisition.

### Stylistic Effect
Through fairy tale formula, existential construction, progressive participles, redundant relative clause, polysyndetic coordination, and neologistic phonetics, Joyce creates syntax of infantile consciousness—grammar that renders narrative through the linguistic structures of early childhood, collapsing distance between teller and told.
