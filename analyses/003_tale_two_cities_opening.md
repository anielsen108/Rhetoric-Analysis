# Passage 003: A Tale of Two Cities Opening

## Author and Source
**Charles Dickens**, *A Tale of Two Cities* (1859), Book 1, Chapter 1

## Passage
> It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition of words at the beginning of successive clauses.
*Example:* "It was the..." repeated throughout.
*Effect:* Creates insistent rhythm, accumulative force, and sense of inevitability; hammers home the contradictions.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Direct opposition or contrast between ideas.
*Example:* Every clause contrasts its successor: best/worst, wisdom/foolishness, belief/incredulity.
*Effect:* Emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the revolutionary period; creates dramatic tension.

### **Parallelism** (par-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structure repeated across clauses.
*Example:* Every clause follows identical structure: "it was the [noun] of [noun]"
*Effect:* Creates hypnotic rhythm and sense of formal balance; makes contradictions more striking through identical frames.

### **Isocolon** (eye-so-KOH-lon)
*Definition:* Succession of clauses of approximately equal length and structure.
*Example:* The parallel clauses are roughly equal in length and identical in structure.
*Effect:* Produces formal, almost ritualistic quality; suggests historical forces in balance.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Statement that seems contradictory but contains truth.
*Example:* The entire passage—asserting opposites simultaneously.
*Effect:* Captures the complexity and contradictions of revolutionary times; resists simple interpretation.

### **Syncrisis** (SIN-kri-sis)
*Definition:* Comparison between opposites.
*Example:* Systematic pairing of opposites throughout.
*Effect:* Emphasizes the dual nature of the historical moment.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Sentence Pattern
This is an example of **pure parataxis**—independent clauses linked by simple coordination with no subordination. The sentence could continue infinitely with the same structure, creating a sense of endless contradiction.

### Syntactic Architecture
The passage builds through **additive syntax**, each clause adding to the accumulation without hierarchy. This is what Tufte calls **coordinate** rather than **subordinate** structure—no clause is grammatically superior to another, mirroring the equal validity (or equal invalidity) of the contradictory claims.

### The Power of Repetition
The **exact repetition** of "it was the" at the start of each clause creates a drumbeat effect. This is syntax as incantation. The refusal to vary the opening (as a less skilled writer might: "It was the best of times, but also the worst...") maintains the formal, almost liturgical quality.

### Strategic Use of Punctuation
Dickens uses **commas** rather than periods or semicolons between these independent clauses. This choice creates a breathless, continuous flow—the contradictions tumble over one another without pause for resolution. The syntax enacts the overwhelming, chaotic nature of the period described.

### Noun Choices and Syntax Interaction
Notice the progression in noun choices:
- times (general)
- age (philosophical/intellectual)
- epoch (historical)
- season (natural/cyclical)
- spring/winter (specific seasonal metaphors)

The syntax remains constant while the nouns vary, creating unity with diversity.

### Binary Structure
Each clause contains a **binary opposition**:
- best ↔ worst
- wisdom ↔ foolishness
- belief ↔ incredulity
- Light ↔ Darkness
- spring/hope ↔ winter/despair

The syntax enforces this binary structure through perfect parallelism, but the accumulation of binaries suggests reality is more complex than any simple opposition.

### Capitalization as Syntax
Note the capitalization of "Light" and "Darkness"—not just words but allegorical forces. This typographical choice is part of the syntactic effect, elevating these particular oppositions to mythic status.

### Rhythm and Meter
The passage has an almost **iambic quality**:
"it WAS the BEST of TIMES, it WAS the WORST of TIMES"

This rhythmic regularity makes the passage memorable and gives it formal, almost poetic authority.

### Syntactic Suspension and Incompletion
Intriguingly, the sentence doesn't end here in the novel—it continues with more parallel clauses. The syntax suggests that the contradictions could go on forever, that the period cannot be summarized, only accumulated into increasingly paradoxical description.

### Stylistic Effect
Through relentless parallel syntax and systematic opposition, Dickens creates prose that embodies historical dialectic. The syntax doesn't resolve contradictions—it presents them in perfect balance, suggesting that revolutionary periods contain their opposites simultaneously. The form is the content.
