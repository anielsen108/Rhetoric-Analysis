# Passage 112: "Nora's Awakening"

## Author and Source
**Henrik Ibsen**, *A Doll's House* (1879, translated from Norwegian)

## Passage
> I have been your doll-wife, just as at home I was papa's doll-child; and here the children have been my dolls. I thought it great fun when you played with me, just as they thought it great fun when I played with them. That is what our marriage has been, Torvald.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "I have been...I was...I thought...I played"
*Effect:* Accumulates realizations of objectification.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Nora as "doll-wife" and "doll-child"
*Effect:* Makes objectification explicit through toy metaphor.

### **Parallelism** (pair-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structures.
*Example:* "your doll-wife...papa's doll-child...my dolls"
*Effect:* Shows recursive pattern of objectification across generations.

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus)
*Definition:* Inverted parallel.
*Example:* "you played with me...I played with them"
*Effect:* Reveals cycle of treating humans as toys.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Present Perfect Declaration
"I have been your doll-wife"—**present perfect** emphasizes duration up to present moment. Syntax marks end of long-term state.

### Compound Metaphor
"doll-wife...doll-child"—**hyphenated compound nouns**. Syntax fuses human role with object status.

### Comparative Clause
"just as at home I was"—**subordinate comparative** with fronted locative. Syntax links two sites of objectification.

### Parallel Evaluation
"I thought it great fun...they thought it great fun"—**parallel clauses** with identical predicate. Syntax shows shared delusion.

### Temporal Clause
"when you played with me...when I played with them"—**parallel temporal clauses**. Syntax creates cycle of play as oppression.

### Demonstrative Summary
"That is what our marriage has been"—**demonstrative pronoun** with present perfect copula. Syntax reduces marriage to toy playing.

### Direct Address
"Torvald"—**vocative** at end. Syntax confronts husband directly with revelation.

### Stylistic Effect
Through present perfect marking duration, doll-metaphor compounds, parallel temporal clauses showing recursive objectification, and demonstrative reduction of marriage, Ibsen creates syntax of feminist awakening—grammar that names and rejects patriarchal reduction of women to playthings.
