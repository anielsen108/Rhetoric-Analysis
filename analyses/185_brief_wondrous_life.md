# Passage 185: "The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao"

## Author and Source
**Junot Díaz**, *The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao* (2007)

## Passage
> They say it came first from Africa, carried in the screams of the enslaved; that it was the death bane of the Tainos, uttered just as one world perished and another began; that it was a demon drawn into Creation through the nightmare door that was cracked open in the Antilles.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "that it was...that it was...that it was"
*Effect:* Accumulates competing origin myths through parallel structure.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Curse as "death bane"; portal as "nightmare door"
*Effect:* Makes abstract curse into concrete mythological entity.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Demon "drawn into Creation"
*Effect:* Makes curse an active agent with volition.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Generic Subject
"They say"—**indefinite pronoun** with reporting verb. Syntax invokes folkloric authority.

### Object Clause
"it came first from Africa"—**subordinate clause** with ablative origin. Syntax begins first myth.

### Participial Carrying
"carried in the screams of the enslaved"—**past participle** with genitive. Syntax makes Middle Passage the curse's vehicle.

### Anaphoric Parallel
"that it was...that it was...that it was"—**three parallel subordinate clauses**. Syntax accumulates alternative origins.

### Genitive Definition
"the death bane of the Tainos"—**compound noun** with possessive. Syntax names curse through victims.

### Participial Timing
"uttered just as one world perished and another began"—**past participle** with temporal clause. Syntax pinpoints curse to historical moment.

### Nominal Demon
"a demon drawn into Creation"—**indefinite article** with passive participle. Syntax makes supernatural concrete.

### Metaphorical Portal
"through the nightmare door"—**spatial preposition** with metaphor. Syntax creates supernatural entrance.

### Relative Clause
"that was cracked open"—**passive relative**. Syntax shows how portal was breached.

### Locative Antilles
"in the Antilles"—**spatial preposition**. Syntax geographically locates metaphysical event.

### Stylistic Effect
Through generic they-say authority, anaphoric that-it-was parallels, participial carried-in-screams Middle Passage, genitive death-bane naming, temporal one-world-perished/another-began synchrony, metaphorical nightmare-door portal, and passive cracked-open breach in the Antilles, Díaz creates syntax of mythological accumulation—grammar that layers competing curse-origins through parallel structure, making fukú into multivalent Caribbean metaphysics.
