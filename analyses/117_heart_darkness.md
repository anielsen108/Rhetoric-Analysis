## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Epizeuxis** (eh-pih-ZOOK-sis)
*Definition:* Immediate, emphatic repetition.
*Example:* "The horror! The horror!"
*Effect:* Creates overwhelming emphasis; makes horror unspeakable beyond repetition.

### **Exclamation** (eks-kluh-MAY-shun)
*Definition:* Emphatic outcry.
*Example:* Both sentences end with exclamation points.
*Effect:* Expresses extremity of emotion beyond rational articulation.

### **Apophasis** (uh-PAH-fuh-sis)
*Definition:* Claiming not to say what one is saying.
*Example:* Names horror without describing it.
*Effect:* Makes horror too terrible to specify; leaves blank for imagination.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Definite Article
"The horror"—**definite article** implies known, specific horror. Syntax assumes shared understanding of what cannot be named.

### Exclamatory Fragment
Not a complete sentence—**noun phrase only**, no verb. Syntax breaks down under weight of revelation.

### Immediate Repetition
Same phrase twice. Syntax performs inability to move beyond this realization.

### Absence of Elaboration
No modifiers, no relative clauses, no explanation. Syntax refuses or is unable to specify.

### Stylistic Effect
Through definite article suggesting known referent, exclamatory fragments lacking verbs, immediate repetition without variation, and absolute refusal of elaboration, Conrad creates syntax of unspeakable revelation—grammar that breaks down at the limit of what language can articulate, leaving only repeated naming of horror itself.
