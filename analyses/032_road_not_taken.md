## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison between unlike things.
*Example:* Roads as life choices/paths.
*Effect:* Transforms literal scene into universal symbol of decision-making.

### **Enjambment** (en-JAM-ment)
*Definition:* Continuation of sentence across line breaks.
*Example:* "sorry I could not travel both / And be one traveler"
*Effect:* Creates forward momentum; mimics thought process.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "And sorry...And be...And looked"
*Effect:* Creates accumulation of actions and regrets.

### **Alliteration** (uh-lit-uh-RAY-shun)
*Definition:* Repetition of initial consonant sounds.
*Example:* "long I...looked"
*Effect:* Creates musicality and emphasis.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Statement
"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood"—simple subject-verb-prepositional phrase. The **past tense** immediately places us in retrospect. The syntax is deceptively simple for what becomes a complex meditation.

### Apology and Impossibility
"And sorry I could not travel both"—the syntax omits "I was/am" before "sorry," creating compression. The **modal negative** "could not" expresses impossibility, not unwillingness.

### The Constraint
"And be one traveler"—this phrase explains WHY he couldn't travel both. The syntax makes the constraint existential: being ONE traveler means choosing ONE path. The number creates the dilemma.

### Duration
"long I stood"—inverted syntax (normally "I stood long") creates archaic, formal tone. The **adverb "long"** emphasizes the duration of deliberation.

### Visual Limitation
"as far as I could / To where it bent"—the syntax emphasizes the limit of vision. We can only see SO FAR, then the path curves away. This visual limitation becomes metaphor for inability to foresee consequences of choices.

### Stylistic Effect
Through simple syntax, conversational tone, and accumulated detail, Frost creates his most famous (and most misread) poem. The syntax performs deliberation—the "And...And...And" creates the sense of someone thinking through a decision step by step. The form is the thought process itself.
