## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Extended Metaphor** (ek-STEN-ded MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Sustained comparison throughout passage.
*Example:* Hope as bird throughout the stanza.
*Effect:* Makes abstract emotion concrete, visual, and tangible.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nif-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Attribution of human qualities to non-human things.
*Example:* Hope "perches" and "sings"—bird actions applied to emotion.
*Effect:* Makes hope active, living, present.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Seemingly contradictory statement.
*Example:* "tune without the words"—music that isn't music.
*Effect:* Suggests hope is felt rather than articulated; it transcends language.

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-ton)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions.
*Example:* Series of clauses without "and" until the final line.
*Effect:* Creates staccato rhythm; each quality of hope stands separately.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Scare Quotes
"'Hope' is the thing with feathers"—Dickinson uses **quotation marks** around "Hope," making it both word and concept. The syntax through typography creates distance and intimacy simultaneously—hope is a word we use, but what IS it really?

The **copulative verb "is"** creates definition—this isn't comparison ("hope is like a bird") but equation ("hope IS the thing with feathers").

### Relative Clauses
The poem consists of one sentence with **multiple relative clauses**:
- That perches in the soul
- And [that] sings the tune...
- And [that] never stops

This **cumulative syntax** builds understanding of hope through accumulating characteristics.

### Dashes
Dickinson's famous **em-dashes** appear four times, creating pauses and emphasis. The syntax through punctuation controls rhythm and creates suspension after each revelation about hope.

### Negative Definition
"without the words"—the **prepositional phrase with negative** tells us what hope's song lacks. This apophatic syntax (defining through negation) suggests hope's ineffability.

### Double Negative Emphasis
"never stops - at all"—the phrase "at all" intensifies "never," creating emphasis through syntax. The dash before "at all" makes it an afterthought that becomes the main thought—hope's persistence is absolute.

### Stylistic Effect
Through fragmented syntax, strategic dashes, and cumulative relative clauses, Dickinson creates her signature compressed, intense style. The form embodies hope's nature: small (short lines), persistent (continuous sentence), and ineffable (gaps created by dashes).
