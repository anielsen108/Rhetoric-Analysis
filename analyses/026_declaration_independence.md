# Passage 026: Declaration of Independence - Self-Evident Truths

**Thomas Jefferson (Committee of Five)** · *Declaration of Independence* · 1776 | Preamble sentence 2

**Occasion/Pressure:** Foundational revolutionary document must justify rebellion by appealing to universal principles beyond British law.
**Persona/Stance:** Collective "We" speaking for the Continental Congress—philosopher-statesmen blending Enlightenment logic with prophetic cadence.
**Thesis of Effect:** The sentence's triadic parallelism and passive constructions reframe rights as pre-political givens, drafting an egalitarian grammar that continues to indict the nation.

## PASSAGE

[L1] We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed
[L2] by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

---

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Enthymeme** (EN-thuh-meem / ˈɛnθɪmiːm)
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Argument with implied premise.
**Evidence:** Assumes reader agrees self-evident truths require no proof; unspoken premise: governments violating rights lose legitimacy.
**Effect:** Invites audience to supply shared belief, forging consensus.
**Near-miss:** Not full syllogism; major premise implicit.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh / əˈnæfərə)
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Repetition at clause beginnings.
**Evidence:** Triple "that" launching subordinate clauses.
**Effect:** Builds momentum; each clause heightens stakes.
**Near-miss:** Not epistrophe; repetition occurs at start, not end.

### **Asyndetic Tricolon** (uh-SIN-duh-tik TRI-koh-lon)
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Three-part series with minimal conjunctions.
**Evidence:** "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness" uses single "and".
**Effect:** Memorable cadence; equal weight to each right.
**Near-miss:** Not polysyndeton; connectors restrained.

### **Personification of Abstract Rights**
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Treating abstractions as if tangible possessions.
**Evidence:** Rights "endowed" by Creator; individuals "have" them.
**Effect:** Makes philosophy concrete; rights feel like inheritable property.
**Near-miss:** Not metaphor alone; specific verb "endowed" imagines gifting ceremony.

### **Appeal to Higher Authority (Ethos)**
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Invoking credible source beyond debate.
**Evidence:** "by their Creator" references divine origin.
**Effect:** Places rights above monarch; moral authority outranks temporal power.
**Near-miss:** Not simple theological claim; combined with Enlightenment natural law.

### **Hyperbaton** (hy-PER-buh-ton / haɪˈpɜːrbətən)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Inverted word order for emphasis.
**Evidence:** "We hold these truths" rather than "These truths we hold"—subject first but object emphasized by demonstrative.
**Effect:** Focus on truths before clauses specify them; rhetorical spotlight on what is held.
**Near-miss:** Not extreme inversion; subtle shift suffices.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Parallelism**
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Repetition of grammatical structure.
**Evidence:** Three subordinate clauses "that..." share verb "are" + complement pattern.
**Effect:** Suggests logical inevitability; each clause reinforces preceding.
**Risk:** Could sound monotonous; variety of complements (predicate adjective, passive clause, list) maintains interest.

### **Passive Voice**
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Subject receives action.
**Evidence:** "are created," "are endowed".
**Effect:** Centers recipients; deemphasizes human granters, implying rights precede government.
**Risk:** Passive often weak; here purposeful—lack of agent underscores divine/natural origin.

### **Cumulative Sentence with Appositive Clauses**
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Base clause followed by a series of explanatory subordinate clauses.
**Evidence:** "We hold" + three "that" clauses appositive to "truths".
**Effect:** Readers experience truths unfolding step by logical step.
**Risk:** Without careful punctuation could blur; commas delineate structure.

### **Isocolon** (EYE-soh-koh-lon / ˈaɪsəkəˌlɒn)
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Clauses of similar length and rhythm.
**Evidence:** "that all men are created equal" (8 syllables) vs. "that they are endowed..." (longer but rhythmically comparable); deliberate balance fosters solemnity.
**Risk:** Slight variation prevents mechanical feel.

### **Climactic Ordering**
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Arrangement of items in order of increasing importance or impact.
**Evidence:** After general rights, clause narrows to trio culminating in "pursuit of Happiness"—abstract yet expansive.
**Effect:** Leaves audience contemplating aspirational freedom.
**Risk:** Could seem anticlimactic; pairing tangible (Life, Liberty) with aspirational (Happiness) expands horizon.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Performative First-Person Plural**
**Signals:** "We hold" turns statement into collective speech act.
**Effect on stance:** Congress asserts authority by speaking as unified body; readers enlisted as witnesses.
**Classical kin:** Roman senatus consulta; modern constitutions adopt similar voice.

### **Demonstrative Forward Pointing**
**Signals:** "these truths" announces list before revealing items.
**Effect:** Creates anticipation; rhetorical drumroll.
**Classical kin:** Cicero's catalogues; modern rhetorical strategy of previewing.

### **Nominalization for Universality**
**Signals:** Abstract nouns (Truths, Rights, Happiness) dominate.
**Effect:** Shifts discourse from particular grievances to universal principles.
**Classical kin:** Enlightenment treatises (Locke, Rousseau).

### **Coordination as Equality Engine**
**Signals:** Repeated "that" + "are" treat each clause as coequal.
**Effect:** Syntax enacts equality it proclaims—no clause subordinate to another.
**Classical kin:** Parallel declarations in Magna Carta; Jefferson intensifies for modern republic.

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Crisp monosyllables (We, hold, truths) give declarative punch; polysyllabic "unalienable" introduces legal gravitas; final triad uses alliteration (Life/Liberty) and cadence (da-DUM) culminating in flowing "pursuit of Happiness".

**Cadence seams:** Comma after "self-evident" sets stage for list; each "that" clause like measured bell toll. Final phrase extends with anapest (pursuit of Happiness) leaving uplift.

**Alliteration:** "Life, Liberty" (L-l); "hold"/"these"/"truths" share dental friction; "Creator"/"certain"/"unalienable" c/k sounds add cohesion.

**Assonance:** Long "i" in "Life" / "Liberty"; long "e" in "these" / "equal" fosters tonal harmony.

**Rhythm:** Alternating stressed monosyllables produce marching beat; triad functions as rhetorical crescendo.

**Music argues:** Sentence sounds like oath—designed for oration; cadences support memory and communal recitation.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** One 35-word cumulative sentence anchored by main clause "We hold" followed by three appositive that-clauses.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Subordination via "that" but each clause independent in sense; coordination between items in final series.

**Modification choreography:**
- Predicate adjective "self-evident" qualifies truths before enumeration.
- Clause 1 defines equality; Clause 2 adds source and nature of rights; Clause 3 specifies exemplary rights.
- Prepositional phrase "by their Creator" inserted mid-clause, balancing theology with philosophy.

**Inversion:** Minimal; natural order reinforces clarity. Only notable arrangement is placement of "among these" before list—signals representative sample.

**Information flow:** Claim to self-evidence → definition of equality → source of rights → exemplary enumeration. Logical scaffolding akin to legal argument.

### Micro-rewrites:

**Compressed:** *"We believe all people are equal and possess inherent rights: life, liberty, pursuing happiness."*
**Lost:** Formal authority, divine grounding, rhythm of tricolon.

**Dilated:** *"Acting in congress, we assert that the following principles require no demonstration: first, universal equality in human creation; second, endowment from the Creator of inherent, non-transferable rights; third, the inclusion among such rights of life, liberty, and the active seeking of happiness."*
**Lost:** Sonic elegance; gained: didactic clarity but bureaucratic tone.

**Focalization shift (British loyalist paraphrase):** *"They claim, without proof, that Providence created everyone equal and supplied them with rights they say include life, liberty, and chasing happiness."*
**Effect:** Introduces skepticism; undercuts persuasive ethos.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Present tense "hold" anchors declaration in moment of adoption; demonstrative "these" refers to immediate list.

**Aspect:** Simple present indicates enduring truth; not limited to specific time.

**Modality:** Absence of modals underscores certainty; "self-evident" functions as modal claim (necessity). No "may" or "should"—rights simply are.

**Evidential posture:** Appeals to reason (self-evident) and divine witness (Creator). Authority is dual: Enlightenment rationalism + theological sanction.

**Quoted locus:** None; voice collective but not quoting external authority beyond implicit Creator.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Legal/financial:** "endowed" suggests inheritance; rights as property.
2. **Illumination:** "self-evident" implies truths shining by themselves—echoes Enlightenment light metaphors.
3. **Journey:** "pursuit of Happiness" frames well-being as chase, not static possession.

**Lexical fields:**
- **Philosophical:** truths, equal, Rights.
- **Religious:** Creator.
- **Political:** Liberty, Happiness (public welfare per classical republicanism).

**Image logic:** Rights bestowed like dowry from Creator; humans pursue happiness like quarry; equality grounded in shared origin story.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Institutional—voice of Congress addresses world; zero focalization beyond collective self.

**Time (Genette):**
- **Order:** Present statement; implies past creation event and ongoing pursuit.
- **Duration:** Instantaneous pronouncement with perpetual validity.
- **Frequency:** Singulative moment with iterative implications (truths always held).

**Beat structure:** Declaration of holding truths → articulation of equality → specification of endowment → exemplar list. Each beat raises stakes from philosophical premise to practical rights.

**Subtext:** Despite "all men," document excludes enslaved people, women, Indigenous nations; syntax universalizes ideals that the Revolution itself fails to realize—creating tension fueling future reform movements.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Congress speaks collectively; invoking Creator signals moral legitimacy; Enlightenment diction shows intellectual rigor.

**Pathos:** Triad inspires hope; promise of happiness resonates emotionally.

**Logos:** Logical chain: If truths are self-evident, equality and rights follow; if rights exist, governments violating them are illegitimate (developed later). Sentence functions as major premise.

**Political argument:** Rights are inherent, not royal favors—therefore rebellion is restoration, not revolution of first principles.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Locke's Second Treatise:** Echoes "life, liberty, property"; Jefferson swaps "property" for "pursuit of happiness" to broaden scope.

**Classical rhetoric:** Cicero's balanced clauses; Aristotelian enthymeme structure.

**Religious creeds:** Syntax resembles catechism—"We believe..."; fosters communal recitation.

**Subversion:** Applies Enlightenment ideals to colonial context, weaponizing philosophy against empire; yet partial inclusion foreshadows abolitionist and feminist critiques using same language.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots:
1. **"self-evident"**—Bold assertion eliminating need for debate; rhetorical anchor.
2. **"all men are created equal"**—Foundational egalitarian claim; also point of hypocrisy.
3. **"pursuit of Happiness"**—Innovative right blending public welfare and individual aspiration.

### Faultlines:
1. **Exclusionary language**—"men" originally meant property-holding white males; later generations reinterpret. Tension fuels civil rights struggles.
2. **Creator invocation**—Potential alienation for secular/other-faith audiences; yet 18th-century consensus made it strategic.
3. **Passive voice ambiguity**—No explicit agent of creation/endowment; critics can challenge enforcement. Defense: intentionally situates authority beyond government.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

### Subtraction test:
**Remove:** "by their Creator"
**Result:** Secularizes statement but weakens appeal to higher authority; British crown could claim rights stem from king.

### Amplification test:
**Add:** "including property" to rights list.
**Effect:** Aligns with Locke but narrows revolutionary promise to economic terms; Jefferson's substitution aimed to expand.

### Register shift:
**Legalistic rewrite:** *"The Congress affirms that individuals possess inherent equality and inalienable rights comprising life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."*
**Effect:** Precise yet prosaic; loses oratorical grandeur.

**Colloquial version:** *"We're saying everybody's born equal, already holding rights—living free and chasing happiness."*
**Effect:** Accessible but lacks solemn authority.

### Punctuation swap:
**Replace commas with semicolons between clauses**
**Effect:** Stiffer, more legal; reduces rhythmic flow; Franklin reportedly pushed for comma-based lilt.

### Tense shift:
**Past tense:** "We held these truths"
**Effect:** Suggests belief is former, undermining ongoing commitment.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

### Imitatio:
*We affirm these principles as axiomatic: that all people arrive in the world as equals; that inherent, irrevocable rights accompany them from birth; that among such rights stand breathing, freedom, and the labor of joy.*

**Replicates:** Triadic structure, self-evidence, rights list with abstract final item.

### Counter-Imitatio:
*We suppose some things might be true, maybe that certain folks get rights if governments hand them out.*

**Opposes:** Tentative modal verbs, absence of triad, dependence on government—undermines original force.

### Compression (≤20 words):
*We declare self-evident equality and inherent rights—life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all.*

**Keeps:** Core message; loses rhetorical cadence and divine attribution.

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. **Lead with a collective verb** to transform belief into official act.
2. **Use repeated "that" clauses** for logical, memorable build.
3. **Harness passive voice** when you want origin to appear transcendent.
4. **End lists with aspirational abstraction** to expand moral horizon.
5. **Blend Enlightenment diction with sacred references** for cross-audience appeal.
6. **Deploy triads**—they stick in memory and sound authoritative.
7. **Name truths before enumerating them** to create anticipatory focus.
8. **Design syntax that models equality**—parallel clauses grant equal weight.
