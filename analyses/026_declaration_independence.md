# Passage 026: The Declaration of Independence

## Author and Source
**Thomas Jefferson** (with committee edits), *The Declaration of Independence* (1776)

## Passage
> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-ton)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions between elements in a series.
*Example:* "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"—only one "and" for three major rights.
*Effect:* Creates memorable, rhythmic triplet; emphasizes each right equally.

### **Parallelism** (par-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structures repeated.
*Example:* Three "that" clauses in succession.
*Effect:* Creates formal, logical progression; suggests inevitable conclusions.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "that...that...that"
*Effect:* Builds momentum; creates sense of accumulating truths.

### **Abstractions** (ab-STRAK-shuns)
*Definition:* Use of abstract rather than concrete nouns.
*Example:* Life, Liberty, Happiness, Rights, Creator—all abstract concepts.
*Effect:* Elevates to realm of principle and philosophy; makes claims universal.

### **Passive Construction** (PAS-iv con-STRUK-shun)
*Definition:* Focus on receiver of action rather than agent.
*Example:* "are created," "are endowed"—men receive these qualities.
*Effect:* Emphasizes rights come from nature/God, not human institutions.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Declaration
"We hold these truths to be self-evident"—the syntax begins with **first person plural subject** ("We"), making this a collective statement. The **transitive verb "hold"** (meaning believe, assert) claims these truths.

The **object "these truths"** uses demonstrative pronoun, pointing forward to what follows. The **infinitive complement "to be self-evident"** makes the crucial claim: these aren't merely opinions but self-evident truths requiring no proof.

### Triadic Structure
The passage uses **three parallel "that" clauses**, each beginning with "that" and making a claim:
1. that all men are created equal
2. that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights
3. that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness

This **triadic parallelism** creates rhetorical power through accumulation and rhythm.

### Passive Voice
Both main verbs are **passive**:
- "are created equal" (passive)
- "are endowed...with...Rights" (passive)

This syntax emphasizes that equality and rights are RECEIVED, not achieved or granted by government. The passive construction is philosophically crucial.

### The Triple Rights
"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"—this **series of three** (rule of three) creates memorable rhetoric. Notice "pursuit of" modifies only "Happiness," not the others. The syntax makes clear that happiness itself isn't guaranteed, only its pursuit.

### Stylistic Effect
Through parallel structure, passive construction, and triadic rhythm, Jefferson creates one of the most influential sentences in political history. The syntax performs Enlightenment philosophy—rational, balanced, universal. As Tufte would note, the form embodies the democratic principles it espouses: the parallel structures give each claim equal weight, just as the claims themselves assert equality.
