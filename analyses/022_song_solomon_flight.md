# Passage 022: Song of Solomon - Flight

**Toni Morrison** · *Song of Solomon* · 1977 | Part I, Chapter 1 (Opening)

**Occasion/Pressure:** Opening sentence of the novel must launch the book's mythic obsession with flight while grounding it in Black communal reality and Depression-era detail.
**Persona/Stance:** Third-person communal chronicler with folkloric authority; voice oscillates between reportorial exactness and mythic awe.
**Thesis of Effect:** The syntax stages collective witnessing of a miraculous-suicidal act, marrying ledger-like specificity to ancestral longing so that literal grammar holds spiritual yearning.

## PASSAGE

[L1] The North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance agent promised to fly from Mercy to the other
[L2] side of Lake Superior at three o'clock. Two days before the event was to take place he
[L3] tacked a note on the door of his little yellow house: At 3:00 P.M. on Wednesday the 18th
[L4] of February, 1931, I will take off from Mercy and fly away on my own wings. Please forgive
[L5] me. I loved you all. (signed) Robert Smith, Ins. agent.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Prolepsis** (pro-LEP-sis / prəʊˈlɛpsɪs)
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Reference to a future action as if already secured.
**Evidence:** "promised to fly" treats the impossible deed as certain; "event was to take place" frames it like scheduled ritual.
**Effect:** Locks reader into inevitability—community is already braced for the flight. Suspense shifts from *if* to *how* tragedy will unfold.
**Near-miss:** Not foreshadowing alone; the grammar itself asserts future fact, not merely hints.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-feh-miz-um / ˈjuːfəmɪzəm)
**Lines:** L4
**Definition:** Mild expression softening harsh reality.
**Evidence:** "fly away on my own wings" translates suicide into ascension.
**Effect:** Reveals Robert Smith's psyche: he reframes despair as liberation. Community must decipher the euphemism to grasp danger.
**Near-miss:** Not simple metaphor of flight; the phrase replaces the language of death altogether.

### **Epistolary Insert** (eh-PIS-tuh-lair-ee in-SERT)
**Lines:** L3-5
**Definition:** Embedded written document within narrative.
**Evidence:** Full reproduction of Smith's handwritten note.
**Effect:** Produces documentary authenticity; reader encounters primary evidence rather than narrator's paraphrase.
**Near-miss:** Not free indirect discourse; we are given direct transcription with typography mimicking posted notice.

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee / ˈaɪrəni)
**Lines:** L1, L3-4
**Definition:** Tension between literal statement and underlying reality.
**Evidence:** Insurance agent—the professional of risk mitigation—plans reckless flight; "own wings" implies ability he lacks.
**Effect:** Highlights socio-economic desperation; communal systems designed to protect become staging grounds for catastrophe.
**Near-miss:** Not sarcasm; narrator never mocks, simply lets contradiction resonate.

### **Specificity** (spes-ih-FIS-ih-tee / ˌspɛsɪˈfɪsɪti)
**Lines:** L3-4
**Definition:** Dense, precise detail functioning as rhetorical device.
**Evidence:** "3:00 P.M. ... Wednesday the 18th of February, 1931" reads like ledger entry.
**Effect:** Anchors mythic event in credible history. Precision builds trust and heightens dissonance with impossible claim.
**Near-miss:** Not mere exposition—detail quantity creates rhetorical insistence on reality.

### **Apologia** (ah-poh-LOH-jee-uh / ˌæpəˈloʊdʒiə)
**Lines:** L4-5
**Definition:** Formal defense or plea for pardon.
**Evidence:** "Please forgive me. I loved you all." echoes suicide-note conventions.
**Effect:** Humanizes Robert; he frames act as necessary departure, seeking absolution.
**Near-miss:** Not confession of guilt; he does not name offense, only anticipates grief.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Periodic Structure** (peer-ee-AH-dik STRUK-cher)
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Main clause withheld until sentence end.
**Evidence:** "Two days before..." delays subject and verb until "he tacked a note".
**Effect:** Mimics suspenseful breath—community waiting before action occurs.
**Risk:** Overlong suspension could confuse; Morrison releases tension with plain predicate.

### **Colon as Hinged Aperture**
**Lines:** L3
**Definition:** Colon introduces elaboration or quotation.
**Evidence:** "house:" opens door for full text of the note.
**Effect:** Functions like stage curtain; readers step from narration into Robert's voice.
**Risk:** Without contextual build-up colon would feel abrupt; here anticipation primes us.

### **Asyndetic Enumeration** (uh-SIN-duh-tik en-yoo-muh-RAY-shun)
**Lines:** L4
**Definition:** Listing without repeated conjunctions.
**Evidence:** "At 3:00 P.M. on Wednesday the 18th of February, 1931" strings details via commas.
**Effect:** Rapid-fire data conveys bureaucratic mindset; note sounds official, rehearsed.
**Risk:** Could feel breathless; Morrison balances with periodic punctuation.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh / əˈnæfərə)
**Lines:** L4-5
**Definition:** Repetition at clause openings.
**Evidence:** "I will... I loved..." successive declarations.
**Effect:** Establishes first-person agency; Robert asserts intention then affection.
**Risk:** Monotony; mitigated by shift from future to past tense.

### **Parataxis** (PAIR-uh-TAK-sis / ˌpærəˈtæksɪs)
**Lines:** L1-5
**Definition:** Coordination without subordination; clauses lined sequentially.
**Evidence:** Narrative strings independent statements, linked by periods more than subordination.
**Effect:** Chronicle-like cadence; events recounted as facts, letting reader infer emotion.
**Risk:** Could sound flat; rich diction and contextual irony supply charge.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Documentary Register Switching**
**Signals:** Narrative voice (third-person) hands microphone to bureaucratic memo voice in note.
**Effect on stance:** Creates heteroglossia; we feel community's observation and Robert's self-account simultaneously. Authority disperses among voices.
**Classical kin:** Epistolary insertion from Richardson to Dostoevsky; Morrison wields it to blend folklore with archive.

### **Infinitives of Purpose**
**Signals:** "to fly," "to take off" embed volition.
**Effect on time/authority:** Grammar grants Robert agentive teleology; he isn't falling but embarking. Syntax dignifies delusion.
**Classical kin:** Latin final infinitives; modern narrative uses to dramatize intention.

### **Temporal Layering via Past-Prospective**
**Signals:** "was to take place" employs past tense governing future-in-the-past.
**Effect:** Narration occupies vantage after event; community already knows outcome. Reader is ushered into retrospective inevitability.
**Classical kin:** Genette's analepsis/prophecy interplay.

### **Appositive Credentials**
**Signals:** "Robert Smith, Ins. agent." appositive retains professional label.
**Effect:** Maintains social identity even posthumously; grammar refuses to let him shed communal role.
**Classical kin:** Roman titulature; modern sociolinguistics of naming.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Heavy trochaic thumps—"North Carolina Mutual"—followed by clipped consonants (tacked, note). Robert's sentences soften into lullaby of liquids ("fly away," "own wings").

**Cadence seams:** Period after L1 is hinge between rumor and preparation. Colon in L3 is breathless intake before reading aloud. Short fragments ("Please forgive me.") punch like drumbeats.

**Alliteration:** "Mercy...Mutual" m-echo; "fly...from" f glide; "Please...forgive" p/f friction exposing anxiety.

**Assonance:** Long "o" in "own," "note," "home" (implied) warms even as death looms; short "i" in "little," "wings" pricks with nervous energy.

**Rhythm:** Alternation between expansive documentary clause and terse plea enacts jump from public spectacle to private ache.

**Music argues:** Sound patterning persuades us this is communal chant—the town rehearsing facts to contain fear.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:**
- Sentence 1: Declarative, 25 words, subject heavy with modifiers, main verb near center.
- Sentence 2: Periodic; subordinate temporal clause precedes main clause.
- Sentence 3-5: Embedded direct discourse replicating note's three-sentence structure.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Sparse subordination (single temporal clause) against series of independent statements. Authority emanates from unadorned reporting.

**Modification choreography:**
- Prepositional pile: "from Mercy," "to the other side," "at three o'clock" create flight plan.
- Adjectival cluster: "little yellow house" compresses socioeconomic portrait.
- Numeral precision: "3:00 P.M...18th...1931" adds bureaucratic seal.

**Inversion:** Minimal—Morrison favors canonical order to imitate official notice; only when quoting note does she maintain standard order to mirror Robert's careful script.

**Information flow:** Institutional identity → promised miracle → preparatory actions → verbatim proclamation → emotional coda → signature. Escalation from communal observation to intimate confession.

### Micro-rewrites:

**Compressed:** *"NC Mutual's Robert Smith announced he would fly from Mercy at 3 P.M., leaving a note begging forgiveness and declaring love."*
**Lost:** Ritualistic specificity, tangible note, tonal oscillation between bureaucracy and mysticism.

**Dilated:** *"In the midst of Depression-era Mercy, an employee of the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company publicly committed himself to an aerial departure scheduled for midafternoon, circulating an elaborately timed announcement affixed to his modestly proportioned, yellow-painted residence and concluding with extended requests for absolution and retrospective affection."*
**Lost:** Urgency, folk texture, human voice. Gained: academic distance, but at cost of heart.

**Focalization shift (gossiping neighbor):** *"Honey, that insurance man down on Darling Street says he's fixing to fly come Wednesday at three—posted it right there on his yellow house, begging us to forgive him and swearing he loves everybody."*
**Effect:** Adds communal oral tone but sacrifices ritual grandeur and documentary gravity.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Past-tense narration anchored after events; demonstratives in note ("my own") recentre to Robert's perspective.

**Aspect:** Perfective simple past for communal reporting ("promised," "tacked"); futurity via modal "will" in note; stative affection captured in simple past "loved." Progressive aspect absent—events conceived as decisive, not ongoing.

**Modality:** Strong commitment through "will"; implicit deontic plea in "Please forgive". Absence of hedges underscores fatal resolve.

**Evidential posture:** Narrator implies access to official record (insurance agent, timestamp) and physical artifact (note), inviting reader to trust authenticity.

**Quoted locus:** Direct quotation shifts deictic center from communal to individual, producing double temporality—town recollects while Robert speaks in present of his imminent action.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Aviation/messianic:** promise to "fly," "take off," "wings"—invokes African American folklore of flying Africans.
2. **Bureaucratic/legal:** full company name, timestamp, signature—documents a miracle as ledger entry.
3. **Domestic/humility:** "little yellow house"—earthbound counterweight to skyward yearning.

**Lexical fields:**
- **Proper nouns:** "North Carolina Mutual," "Mercy," "Lake Superior" map Black migration networks.
- **Temporal markers:** "Two days," "3:00 P.M.," "Wednesday"—calendarizing myth.
- **Affective lexemes:** "forgive," "loved"—humanizing coda.

**Image logic:** Vertical tension: rooted house vs. promised sky. Color "yellow" hints hope/sunlight yet may fade; "Mercy" as toponym saturates with biblical resonance.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** External communal narrator with zero interior access to Robert; empathy emerges through his note.

**Time (Genette):**
- **Order:** Slight analepsis (note posted two days prior) recounted after opening claim.
- **Duration:** Summary condenses days into handful of clauses; embedded note re-expands moment.
- **Frequency:** Singulative recounting of singular event, but diction implies legendary repetition (folkloric flight motif).

**Beat structure:** Identify actor → announce miraculous plan → recount preparation → quote proclamation → deliver plea → authenticate with signature. Each beat escalates intimacy while tightening inevitability.

**Subtext:** Under Jim Crow, economic straits convert protective institutions into catapults for self-annihilation. Robert's yearning for wings encodes diasporic longing for escape from racial constraint.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Official names, timestamps, and professional titles construct documentary credibility; the narrator sounds like community record-keeper.

**Pathos:** Final pleas and affectionate declaration elicit communal sorrow. Juxtaposition of bureaucratic diction with tender closing intensifies tragedy.

**Logos:** Logical sequencing—promise → preparation → announcement—renders irrational act comprehensible within communal logic of obligation.

**Mythic argument:** Syntax fuses African diasporic legends of flight with Depression-era realism, asserting spiritual survival strategies within oppressive structures.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Afro-Atlantic flying myth:** Resonates with folktales of enslaved people taking flight—Morrison modernizes by giving detailed itinerary.

**Harlem Renaissance reportage (Hughes, Hurston):** Blend of vernacular life with lyrical myth; attention to communal spectatorship.

**Biblical proclamations:** Note echoes prophetic declarations ("Thus saith"), but with secular timestamp—hybrid scripture and telegram.

**Modernist documentary fiction (Dos Passos):** Use of montage and inserted documents to layer voices.

**Subversion:** Morrison repurposes institutional language (insurance, schedule) to narrate communal myth, exposing limits of bureaucratic salvation for Black Americans.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots:
1. **"promised to fly"**—Performative verb binds Robert to impossible covenant; tension between duty and desire ignites narrative.
2. **"little yellow house"**—Miniature domestic image saturated with tenderness; visualizes stakes of loss.
3. **"fly away on my own wings"**—Literal impossibility voiced with serene certainty; motif that haunts entire novel.

### Faultlines:
1. **Reliance on euphemism**—Risk: reader might misread as whimsical. Defense: subsequent plot confirms fatal leap; euphemism reveals coping mechanism.
2. **Documentary overload**—Risk: proper nouns could feel info-dumpy. Defense: necessary to anchor magical element in real Black institution.
3. **Professional title at signature**—Risk: reduces Robert to job function. Defense: underscores tragedy—he cannot escape systemic role even in final act.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

### Subtraction test:
**Remove:** "little" from "little yellow house"
**Result:** "yellow house" loses intimacy; community affection drains away.

### Amplification test:
**Heighten:** Explicitly label act as suicide
**Result:** *"...I will take off...to end my life."*
**Gain:** Immediate clarity. **Risk:** Strips metaphor of interpretive richness; undermines novel's central ambiguity about flight vs. fall.

### Register shift:
**Formal bureaucratic:** *"This is to inform all interested parties that Robert Smith intends aerial departure at 1500 hours, February 18, 1931. Kindly pardon any inconvenience."*
**Effect:** Satirical coldness; exposes absurdity of paperwork logic when applied to existential yearning.

**Colloquial gossip:** *"He stuck that paper up saying he's flying out Wednesday, bless him, asking us to forgive and remember he loved us."*
**Effect:** Warm neighborly tone but diminishes mythic gravitas.

### Punctuation swap:
**Replace colon with dash:** "house- At 3:00..."
**Effect:** Dash injects informality, loses sense of official proclamation; colon better mimics posted notice.

### Tense shift:
**Present progressive:** "is promising to fly" and "is tacking a note"
**Effect:** Heightens immediacy but erases retrospective communal knowledge; undermines legendary framing.

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

### Imitatio (new content, same scaffolding):
*The Bethlehem Steel welder pledged to walk across Lake Erie at dawn. Three days ahead he stapled a flyer to the mill gate: At 6:15 A.M. this Saturday I will step from pier to horizon under my own power. Pray for me. Remember I held you all close. (signed) Lila Mae Carter, welder.*

**Replicates:** Formal promise, precise scheduling, embedded note, plea for forgiveness, occupational signature.

### Counter-Imitatio (same content, opposing scaffolding):
*I remember laughing when Robert said he'd sprout wings by Wednesday; he couldn't keep a schedule to save his life, yet there he was, handing out scribbled apologies like church fans.*

**Opposes:** First-person skeptical voice, evaluative commentary, refusal of documentary tone, syntactic looseness.

### Compression (≤20 words):
*Insurance man Robert Smith scheduled his own flight from Mercy, posting a forgiving love note before leaping.*

**Keeps:** Core facts. **Loses:** Ritual cadence, mythic resonance, textual heteroglossia.

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. **Fuse ledger detail with mythic imagery** to make the incredible feel inevitable.
2. **Use embedded documents** for tonal contrast and credibility.
3. **Let infinitives of purpose confer agency**, even on doomed acts.
4. **Name colors and sizes sparingly** to humanize spaces quickly.
5. **Balance long declaratives with short pleas** to orchestrate emotional beats.
6. **Sign with titles** when you want social identity to cling to character.
7. **Anchor miracles in specific times/places** so myth grows from fact, not whimsy.
8. **Exploit colon reveals** to shift voice without narration commentary.
