## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Prolepsis** (pro-LEP-sis)
*Definition:* Reference to future event as if already accomplished.
*Example:* "promised to fly"—presenting impossible future action as fait accompli.
*Effect:* Creates dramatic irony; we know this "flight" will be tragic.

### **Epistolary Form** (eh-PIS-tuh-lair-ee form)
*Definition:* Use of letter or written message within narrative.
*Example:* The quoted note on the door.
*Effect:* Creates intimacy and immediacy; we read his actual words.

### **Dramatic Irony** (druh-MAT-ik EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Audience knows more than characters.
*Example:* We understand "fly away" means suicide; others might take it literally.
*Effect:* Creates tension and pathos; tragic knowledge before the tragedy.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-feh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "fly away" for jumping to death.
*Effect:* Reveals character's psychology; he frames death as liberation.

### **Specificity** (spes-ih-FIS-ih-tee)
*Definition:* Use of precise, particular details.
*Example:* "3:00 P.M. on Wednesday the 18th of February, 1931"
*Effect:* Makes the fantastic precise; grounds magical thinking in documentary reality.

### **Apologia** (ap-oh-LOH-jee-uh)
*Definition:* Formal defense or justification.
*Example:* "Please forgive me. I loved you all."
*Effect:* Suicide note conventions; reveals guilt and love coexisting.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Statement
"The North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance agent promised to fly from Mercy to the other side of Lake Superior at three o'clock"—this is a **long subject** followed by verb and infinitive phrase. The syntax is deceptively matter-of-fact for an impossible claim.

The **subject** is remarkably specific: "The North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance agent." This is **not a name but a title/job description**. The syntax establishes him first through professional identity before we learn his name (which comes later, in the note).

The **full company name** "North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance" creates formal, documentary tone. This is syntax as historical record—Morrison grounds her magical realism in actual historical detail (NC Mutual was a real, prominent Black insurance company).

### Verb Choice
"promised"—this verb is crucial. Not "planned" or "intended" but **"promised"** (a performative speech act). The syntax makes it a commitment to others, not just personal decision. A promise creates obligation, expectation.

### Infinitive of Purpose
"to fly from Mercy to the other side of Lake Superior"—the **infinitive phrase** expresses the promise's content. The syntax treats flying as simple future action, grammatically no different from "promised to walk" or "promised to drive."

The **prepositional phrases** create precise geography:
- "from Mercy" (starting point—name loaded with irony)
- "to the other side of Lake Superior" (destination)

The syntax creates a **flight plan**, complete with origin and destination, as if this were normal travel. The geographical specificity (Lake Superior) grounds the fantastic in real place.

### Temporal Specification
"at three o'clock"—the **prepositional phrase** provides precise time. The syntax makes everything exact, scheduled, planned. The precision creates cognitive dissonance: impossible acts announced with clockwork specificity.

### Temporal Frame
"Two days before the event was to take place"—this **subordinate clause** provides narrative context. The syntax uses:
- Specific duration: "Two days before"
- Nominal phrase: "the event" (euphemistic, treating suicide as mere "event")
- Passive construction: "was to take place"

The phrase **"was to take place"** uses the construction "was to + infinitive" indicating scheduled future action viewed from past perspective. This syntactic formality treats the suicide with the grammar of social events.

### Action Verb
"he tacked a note on the door"—after the elaborate subject and temporal frame, we get **simple past tense action**: subject-verb-object-prepositional phrase. The syntax is suddenly direct after the buildup.

The verb **"tacked"** is specific—not "put" or "left" but "tacked" (with tacks/nails), suggesting permanence, visibility, effort.

### Modest Modification
"his little yellow house"—the **possessive + two adjectives + noun** creates a specific image. The modifiers are:
- "little" (size, suggesting modesty)
- "yellow" (color, cheerful color contrasting with content)

The syntax creates pathos through these domestic details. This is someone with a "little yellow house"—humble, specific, real.

### Colon and Embedded Document
The **colon** after "house:" signals that what follows is the actual text of the note. This is **syntactic embedding**—the note's complete text is incorporated into the narrative syntax.

Morrison **reproduces the note verbatim**, complete with its own internal syntax. This creates what narrative theorists call **heteroglossia**—two voices/syntactic registers within one text.

### Note's Opening
"At 3:00 P.M. on Wednesday the 18th of February, 1931, I will take off from Mercy and fly away on my own wings"—the note uses **formal, precise syntax** of announcement:

The **temporal specification** is extraordinary:
- Time: "3:00 P.M." (exact time with abbreviations)
- Day: "Wednesday"
- Date: "the 18th of February"
- Year: "1931"

This **syntactic specificity** creates multiple effects:
- Documentary realism (these seem like real facts)
- Obsessive precision (he's planned this to the minute)
- Formal announcement (syntax of scheduled events)

The syntax treats suicide with the grammar of appointments.

### First Person Emergence
"I will take off from Mercy"—after the third-person narration, we suddenly get **first person**: "I." The syntax shifts from external description to internal voice. This creates intimacy and immediacy.

The **future tense** "will" expresses determination and certainty. The syntax doesn't hedge ("might," "plan to") but asserts future action confidently.

The verb phrase **"take off"** is aviation terminology. The syntax maintains the flight metaphor through specific verb choice.

### Compound Predicate
"and fly away on my own wings"—this **coordinate verb phrase** continues the aviation metaphor. The syntax uses:
- Phrasal verb: "fly away" (departure, escape)
- Prepositional phrase: "on my own wings" (means/method)

The phrase **"my own wings"** is syntactically simple but semantically complex. The possessive "my own" emphasizes independence, self-sufficiency, perhaps delusion. The syntax makes literal what's metaphorical (he has no wings).

### Imperative Sentence
"Please forgive me"—this is an **imperative sentence** (command form) softened by "please." The syntax shifts from declaration to request. The grammatical mood changes from indicative (will fly) to imperative (forgive).

The **direct address implied** (forgive me = you forgive me) creates relationship between writer and readers. The syntax acknowledges audience and relationship.

### Declarative of Affection
"I loved you all"—this **simple declarative** uses past tense. Why past tense? Because from the perspective of when they'll read this (after his death), his love will be in the past? Or because he's already emotionally departed?

The syntax is stripped to essentials: subject-verb-object. No modifiers, no qualifications—just the bare declaration.

The **pronoun "you all"** (second person plural, Southern dialect) indicates community. The syntax through pronoun choice reveals region and audience—he's addressing everyone, not individuals.

### Signature
"(signed) Robert Smith, Ins. agent"—the **signature** uses:
- Parenthetical notation: "(signed)"
- Full name: "Robert Smith"
- Title abbreviation: "Ins. agent"

The syntax of signatures is **performative**—signing makes the document official. The **parenthetical "(signed)"** is narrator's addition, not part of the note itself, creating syntactic layering.

The **abbreviation "Ins."** maintains formality while compressing. He signs with his professional title, maintaining identity as insurance agent even in suicide note.

### Sentence Types in the Note
The embedded note contains **three sentence types**:
1. Declarative (I will take off...)
2. Imperative (Please forgive me)
3. Declarative (I loved you all)

This **syntactic variety** within a short note creates emotional complexity—statement of intention, request for forgiveness, declaration of love.

### Formality vs. Intimacy
The syntax oscillates between:
- **Formal**: precise time/date, "take off," "Ins. agent"
- **Intimate**: "Please forgive me," "I loved you all"

This **syntactic register-shifting** reveals character—he's simultaneously formal/professional and emotionally vulnerable.

### Passive and Active
The passage balances:
- Active: "promised," "tacked," "will take off," "fly away"
- Passive: "was to take place," (implied) "be forgiven"

This **syntactic balance** between agency and passivity mirrors the psychological state—he's taking action but also being acted upon by forces beyond control.

### The Name "Mercy"
The place name **"Mercy"** appears twice ("from Mercy"). The syntax treats it as mere location, but the semantic weight (mercy = compassion, forgiveness) creates irony. Flying FROM Mercy suggests leaving compassion behind, though he asks for forgiveness. The syntax through capitalized place name embeds theological/moral language.

### Historical Grounding
The **specific date "1931"** is historically significant—this is Depression era. Morrison's syntax grounds magical realism in historical specificity. The documentary precision of syntax creates believability for the fantastic content.

### Parenthetical Syntax
The **parenthetical "(signed)"** is the narrator's interjection into the quoted document. This creates syntactic complexity—we're reading Morrison's sentence containing Robert Smith's note containing the narrator's notation about the signature. This is **nested syntax**, levels of discourse embedded within each other.

### Stylistic Effect
Through the juxtaposition of matter-of-fact narration and desperate epistolary document, Morrison creates one of the most memorable openings in contemporary American literature. The syntax performs the novel's central theme: the tension between the desire for flight/freedom and the weight of community obligation.

As Tufte emphasizes, this is **syntax as tragicomic vision**—the formal, precise syntax (exact times, full company name, signature) applied to an impossible, tragic act (human flight) creates a peculiar tone: simultaneously serious and surreal, tragic and almost absurd. The documentary precision of syntax makes us take the fantastic seriously while recognizing its impossibility.

The embedded note's syntax—its precision, its formality, its emotional vulnerability—reveals Morrison's compassion for her character even as she presents his delusion. The form honors both the tragedy and the dream. This is syntax that can hold contradictions: real company name and impossible flight, precise appointment and metaphorical wings, formal announcement and desperate farewell. The grammar itself performs what the novel explores: the human need to escape and the equally human need to be forgiven and remembered. Form and content achieve perfect, heartbreaking unity.
