## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* Sound "like a breaking harp-string"
*Effect:* Makes mysterious sound musical, cultured, elegant even in breaking.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to non-human.
*Example:* Sound "dying away mournfully"
*Effect:* Makes sound feel emotions; foreshadows human loss.

### **Synesthesia** (sin-es-THEE-zhuh)
*Definition:* Mixing sensory modes.
*Example:* Sound described visually ("from the sky") and emotionally ("mournfully")
*Effect:* Creates multisensory impression of dissolution.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Passive Construction
"A sound is heard"—**passive voice** removes agent. Syntax makes sound's origin mysterious.

### Relative Clause Seeming
"that seems to come from the sky"—**relative clause** with verb of appearing. Syntax emphasizes uncertainty, impression over fact.

### Prepositional Source
"from the sky"—**prepositional phrase** indicating origin. Syntax makes source celestial, otherworldly.

### Comparative Clause
"like a breaking harp-string"—**prepositional phrase** of comparison. Syntax provides specific image for mysterious sound.

### Participial Conclusion
"dying away mournfully"—**present participle** with manner adverb. Syntax performs the fading through grammatical continuation.

### Stylistic Effect
Through passive voice removing origin, relative clause of seeming, celestial source, harp-string comparison, and participial dying away, Chekhov creates syntax of mysterious dissolution—grammar that makes a simple stage direction into symbol of class and culture's elegant, mournful disappearance.
