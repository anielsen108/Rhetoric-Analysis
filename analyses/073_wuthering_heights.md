# Passage 073: Wuthering Heights

## Author and Source
**Emily Brontë**, *Wuthering Heights* (1847), Chapter 9

## Passage
> My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison using "like."
*Example:* Love "like the foliage"; love "resembles...rocks"
*Effect:* Makes abstract emotion concrete through natural imagery.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* Foliage (changeable) vs. rocks (eternal); surface vs. depth
*Effect:* Contrasts two kinds of love through parallel syntax.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Loves as natural phenomena.
*Effect:* Makes passion elemental, fundamental as geology.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Parallel Opening
"My love for Linton is like...My love for Heathcliff resembles"—**parallel subject-verb-complement** structures create balanced comparison.

Both begin with **possessive + noun + prepositional phrase** (My love for X), emphasizing ownership and direction of love.

### First Simile
"like the foliage in the woods"—**simile** using "like" + noun phrase. The **prepositional phrase "in the woods"** locates the foliage.

### Temporal Prediction
"time will change it"—**future tense** prediction with **subject "time"** as agent. Abstract time acts on love-as-foliage.

### Parenthetical Awareness
"I'm well aware"—**parenthetical clause** shows self-consciousness. Catherine knows this love is temporary.

### Comparative Clause
"as winter changes the trees"—**subordinate comparative clause** extends the natural metaphor. Syntax parallels structure: time changes love AS winter changes trees.

### Second Comparison
"resembles the eternal rocks beneath"—shifts from "like" to **verb "resembles"**, creating syntactic variety. The **modifier "eternal"** is key—not temporary like foliage.

The **adverb "beneath"** suggests foundation, depth, what's under surface.

### Appositive Explanation
"a source of little visible delight, but necessary"—**noun phrase in apposition** to "rocks," explaining their function. The **antithesis** "little...delight, but necessary" captures paradox through coordinate opposition.

### Stylistic Effect
Through parallel similes, temporal predictions, and antithetical modifiers, Brontë creates syntax of fatal passion. Form performs the division—balanced structures comparing surface love (changeable, visible) with deep love (eternal, necessary). Grammar as psychological truth.
