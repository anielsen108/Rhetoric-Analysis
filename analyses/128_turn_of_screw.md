# Passage 128: "The Turn of the Screw"

## Author and Source
**Henry James**, *The Turn of the Screw* (1898)

## Passage
> I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town, to meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very bad days—found myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Experience as "seesaw"; emotions as "flights and drops"
*Effect:* Makes psychological state into physical motion.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "right throbs and the wrong"; "rising" vs "drops"
*Effect:* Creates oscillation between opposed states.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "found...felt" in parallel clauses.
*Effect:* Accumulates stages of doubt.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Present Tense Memory
"I remember"—**simple present** for past recollection. Syntax makes memory vivid, immediate.

### Metaphoric Apposition
"as a succession of flights and drops, a little seesaw"—**two appositive metaphors**. Syntax offers multiple images for same experience.

### Genitive Specification
"of the right throbs and the wrong"—**genitive phrase** with definite articles making abstractions concrete. Syntax treats emotions as knowable objects.

### Temporal Participle
"After rising, in town, to meet his appeal"—**participial phrase** with embedded prepositional phrases. Syntax creates dense, qualified temporal sequence.

### Emphatic Phrase
"at all events"—**parenthetical intensifier**. Syntax shows narrator asserting truth despite uncertainty.

### Compound Past Tense
"found myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake"—**two parallel verbs** with embedded subordinate clause. Syntax performs the oscillation it describes.

### Reflexive Construction
"found myself doubtful"—**reflexive object** with adjective. Syntax shows self-discovery of doubt.

### Past Perfect Mistake
"I had made a mistake"—**past perfect** in subordinate clause. Syntax locates error before moment of recognition.

### Stylistic Effect
Through present-tense memory, metaphoric seesaw apposition, dense participial qualification, reflexive discovery, and oscillating compound verbs, James creates syntax of psychological ambivalence—grammar that performs narrator's instability through syntactic hesitation and self-correction.
