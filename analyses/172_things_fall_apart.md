## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement.
*Example:* "well known" for legendary status.
*Effect:* Understates through restrained language.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Fame "resting on" achievements like building on foundation.
*Effect:* Makes reputation into architectural structure.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* "even beyond" - fame extending past regional boundaries.
*Effect:* Suggests unlimited reach of reputation.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Passive Recognition
"was well known"—**passive copula** with adverbial. Syntax shows Okonkwo as object of others' knowledge.

### Adverbial Degree
"well"—**manner adverb** modifying known. Syntax qualifies extent of fame.

### Prepositional Scope
"throughout the nine villages"—**spatial preposition** with specific number. Syntax defines geographical extent.

### Intensifying Addition
"and even beyond"—**coordinate with intensifier**. Syntax extends fame past defined boundary.

### Possessive Fame
"His fame"—**possessive with abstract noun**. Syntax makes reputation something owned.

### Intransitive Rest
"rested on"—**intransitive verb** with prepositional support. Syntax makes fame physically supported.

### Adjectival Foundation
"solid personal achievements"—**two adjectives** modifying noun. Syntax emphasizes both substance and individual agency.

### Stylistic Effect
Through passive well-known recognition, prepositional throughout-nine-villages scope, intensifying even-beyond extension, possessive his-fame ownership, intransitive resting-on metaphor, and adjectival solid-personal foundation, Achebe creates syntax of earned reputation—grammar that makes Okonkwo's fame both geographically extensive and structurally sound, built on individual achievement rather than inherited status.
