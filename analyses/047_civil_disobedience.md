# Passage 047: Civil Disobedience

## Author and Source
**Henry David Thoreau**, *Resistance to Civil Government* (1849)

## Passage
> I heartily accept the motto, "That government is best which governs least"; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe: "That government is best which governs not at all"

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Allusion** (uh-LOO-zhun)
*Definition:* Reference to another text or saying.
*Example:* The motto "That government is best which governs least"
*Effect:* Grounds argument in established principle before radicalizing it.

### **Climax** (KLY-maks)
*Definition:* Arrangement from least to most intense.
*Example:* From "governs least" to "governs not at all"
*Effect:* Builds argument progressively; makes anarchism seem logical conclusion.

### **Parallelism** (par-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structures.
*Example:* Both mottos use identical syntax.
*Effect:* Makes the radicalization seem like natural progression.

### **Quotation** (kwoh-TAY-shun)
*Definition:* Direct citation of others' words.
*Example:* The two mottos in quotation marks.
*Effect:* Claims authority of established wisdom; makes revolution seem traditional.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Declarative
"I heartily accept the motto"—**subject-adverb-verb-object** structure with emphatic adverb "heartily." The syntax makes acceptance enthusiastic, not grudging. First person "I" makes this personal testimony.

### Embedded Quotation
"That government is best which governs least"—the **quoted motto** uses **relative clause** structure. The syntax within quotation is balanced: superlative (best) paired with comparative (least).

The **anaphoric "That government"** creates formal, almost proverbial tone.

### Compound Sentence
"and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically"—the **coordinating conjunction** adds Thoreau's own amendment. The **modal "should like"** is polite but firm.

### Passive Construction
"see it acted up to"—uses **passive voice** (the motto acted upon, not actors). The **prepositional phrase "up to"** creates idiom of fulfillment.

The **comparative adverbs** "more rapidly and systematically" suggest current action is too slow, unsystematic. The syntax through comparison implies progress but inadequate progress.

### Participial Opening
"Carried out"—this **past participle** without subject or auxiliary creates absolute construction. It's compressed syntax: [If it is] carried out...

### Final Result
"it finally amounts to this"—the **present tense** "amounts" suggests inevitable result. The syntax through "finally" and "amounts" makes the conclusion seem logical, mathematical even.

The demonstrative pronoun "this" creates suspense—we wait for what it amounts to.

### Parenthetical Belief
"which also I believe"—the **relative clause** with parenthetical "also" adds personal endorsement. The syntax places "I believe" within the relative clause rather than main sentence, making it seem incidental but significant.

The **adverb "also"** suggests: not only do others believe this (implied), but I do too.

### Second Quotation
"That government is best which governs not at all"—**exact syntactic parallel** to first motto, with only the final phrase changed: "least" becomes "not at all."

This **syntactic parallelism** with semantic escalation is the passage's rhetorical power. The form stays same; only the degree changes. This makes anarchism seem like simple mathematical progression.

### Stylistic Effect
Through embedded quotations, parallel syntax, and logical progression markers, Thoreau creates argument that makes anarchism seem like the inevitable conclusion of accepting limited government. The syntax performs the logic: if A (governs least), then B (governs not at all) follows naturally. The parallel structures suggest these aren't different philosophies but degrees of the same principle. Form IS argument—syntax as political philosophy made grammatically inevitable.
