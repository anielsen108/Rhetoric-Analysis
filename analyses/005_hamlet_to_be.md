# Passage 005: Hamlet's "To Be or Not to Be"

**William Shakespeare** · *Hamlet* · c. 1600 | Act 3, Scene 1, lines 56-60 (opening)

**Occasion/Pressure:** Soliloquy threshold; Hamlet alone on stage must voice existential crisis while audience (and possibly onstage spies) listen; suicide contemplation requires philosophical camouflage.
**Persona/Stance:** First-person thinking-aloud; self-address disguised as universal inquiry; tortured intellectual converting personal despair into abstract philosophy.
**Thesis of Effect:** The syntax performs indecision—infinitives without subjects, correlatives without resolution, metaphors mixing impossibly—grammar enacts paralysis as thinking itself.

## PASSAGE

[L1] To be, or not to be, that is the question:
[L2] Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
[L3] The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
[L4] Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
[L5] And by opposing end them.

---

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis / ænˈtɪθəsɪs)
**Lines:** L1, L2-5
**Definition:** Balanced opposition of ideas.
**Evidence:** "To be, or not to be" (existence/non-existence); "to suffer" (passive) vs. "to take arms" (active).
**Effect:** Reader/auditor experiences binary forced-choice. Antithesis structures thought as either/or, making suicide vs. endurance the only options. But accumulation of antitheses (be/not-be, suffer/fight, passive/active) multiplies choices, creating paralysis through excess of opposition. Each antithesis is grammatically balanced but philosophically unresolvable.
**Near-miss:** Not simple contrast: antithesis requires structural parallelism and opposition.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for / ˈmɛtəfɔːr)
**Lines:** L3-4
**Definition:** Implicit comparison.
**Evidence:** "slings and arrows" (suffering as military assault); "sea of troubles" (troubles as oceanic, drowning).
**Effect:** Abstractions (fortune, troubles) become physical threats. Reader visualizes existential dread as arrows piercing, waves overwhelming. Metaphor makes philosophy visceral—thinking becomes embodied experience. But: metaphors don't cohere (military + oceanic), suggesting mental disarray.
**Near-miss:** Not simile (explicit "like/as"): metaphor asserts identity, not comparison.

### **Catachresis** (KAT-uh-KREE-sis / ˌkætəˈkriːsɪs) [the mixed metaphor]
**Lines:** L4
**Definition:** Strained/impossible metaphor.
**Evidence:** "take arms against a sea"—military action against liquid element. Can't fight ocean with sword.
**Effect:** Reader registers semantic clash: impossibility of action. Catachresis performs Hamlet's dilemma: any response to suffering is category error. The mixed metaphor is the point—to fight fate is as absurd as stabbing water. Reader feels futility through grammatical wrongness.
**Near-miss:** Not dead metaphor (unconscious): catachresis is strained, noticed, problematic.

### **Personification** / **Prosopopoeia** (proh-soh-poh-PEE-uh / ˌprɒsəpəˈpiːə)
**Lines:** L3
**Definition:** Abstraction given agency.
**Evidence:** "outrageous fortune"—fortune capable of moral offense, deliberate cruelty.
**Effect:** Reader experiences fate as antagonist with intent. "Outrageous" (morally offensive) makes fortune malevolent, not random. Personification turns existential question into moral question: if fate is cruel agent, is suicide justified resistance?
**Near-miss:** Not simple metaphor: prosopopoeia grants not just qualities but being/agency.

### **Synecdoche** (sih-NEK-duh-kee / sɪˈnɛkdəki)
**Lines:** L3
**Definition:** Part for whole.
**Evidence:** "slings and arrows"—specific weapons stand for all suffering/attacks.
**Effect:** Reader supplies larger category (all weaponry/harm) from exemplars. Synecdoche makes abstract concrete through metonymic substitution. But also: military specificity suggests Hamlet's preoccupation with revenge (his actual task), bleeding into suicide meditation.
**Near-miss:** Not metonymy (adjacency/association): synecdoche is subset/superset relationship.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Antimetabole** (AN-tee-mi-TAB-uh-lee / ˌæntaɪməˈtæbəli) [conceptual]
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Repetition with inverted structure (AB:BA).
**Evidence:** "To be, or not to be"—repetition of "be" with negation inserted ("be...not be").
**Effect:** Reader experiences thought circling back on itself. Not pure antimetabole (would be "To be, or to not-be not"), but performs similar function: words repeat with inversion, creating loop. Syntax mirrors mental circling, inability to move forward.
**Risk:** Can feel precious. Here, simplicity prevents that.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh / əˈnæfərə)
**Lines:** L2, L4
**Definition:** Repeated opening.
**Evidence:** "Whether...(to suffer)" / "Or to take arms"—both infinitive phrases beginning alternatives.
**Effect:** Anaphora structures choice as grammatically parallel, forcing equal consideration. Reader hears alternatives as co-equal possibilities. But: series could continue infinitely—anaphora threatens to proliferate options without resolution.
**Risk:** Over-repetition numbs. Shakespeare stops at two iterations (suffer/take arms), maintaining tension.

### **Polysyndeton** (pah-lee-SIN-duh-ton / ˌpɒlɪˈsɪndətɒn)
**Lines:** L4-5
**Definition:** Multiplied conjunctions.
**Evidence:** "Or to take arms...And by opposing end them"—"or" and "and" linking actions.
**Effect:** Reader experiences accumulation, cascading consequences. Polysyndeton slows thought, making each step deliberate. "And by opposing" adds layer—taking arms leads to opposing leads to ending. Chain of action made explicit through conjunctions.
**Risk:** Can drag. Here, brief enough to create weight without tedium.

### **Aposiopesis** (ap-oh-sy-oh-PEE-sis / ˌæpəsaɪ.əˈpiːsɪs)
**Lines:** L5 (sentence-level)
**Definition:** Sentence breaking off, incomplete.
**Evidence:** "Whether 'tis nobler..." never receives main clause. Subordinate clause abandoned.
**Effect:** Reader expects completion ("Whether X is true, then Y"). Never arrives. Aposiopesis enacts paralysis—thought cannot complete itself. Syntax mirrors Hamlet's inability to finish thought, reach decision. The incompleteness is the drama.
**Risk:** Can frustrate. Here, frustration is the point—auditor experiences Hamlet's stuckness.

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus / kaɪˈæzməs) [conceptual: active/passive]
**Lines:** L2-5
**Definition:** Inverted structure (ABBA).
**Evidence:** Passive construction ("to suffer") → active ("take arms") → active ("opposing") → passive/intransitive ("end them"—ambiguous agency).
**Effect:** Reader experiences grammatical voice as moral stance. Active verbs (take, oppose) promise agency, but surround/are surrounded by passive (suffer, end). Chiasmic structure suggests no escape—action circles back to passivity.
**Risk:** This is loose chiasmus (thematic, not verbal). Purists might object.

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Bare Infinitive Phrases** (subjectless, free-floating)
**Lines:** L1-5
**Signals:**
- "To be," "to suffer," "to take arms"—infinitives without stated subjects.
- No "I should," "one must"—pure infinitives, abstracted from agent.
**Effect on stance:** Universalizing. Reader receives philosophical question stripped of personal pronouns. "To be" = anyone's existence, not just Hamlet's. Syntax erases speaker, making suicide meditation into metaphysical inquiry. But: audience knows Hamlet speaks—universalism is disguise.
**Classical kin:** Infinitive of indirect discourse (Latin).

### **Correlative Construction** (Whether...or) **Without Resolution**
**Lines:** L2-5
**Signals:**
- "Whether 'tis nobler...Or to take arms"—correlative pair establishing alternatives.
- No main clause follows. Expected: "Whether X or Y, [therefore Z]."
**Effect on stance/time:** Suspends judgment infinitely. Reader waits for resolution that never comes. Correlative promises decision-making structure, then abandons it. Syntax = deferral mechanism. Time stops in the gap between alternatives.
**Classical kin:** Protasis without apodosis (conditional's if-clause without then-clause).

### **Blank Verse / Iambic Pentameter** (metrical structure)
**Lines:** L1-5
**Signals:**
- Five iambic feet per line (da-DUM × 5).
- L1: "to BE or NOT to BE that IS the QUEStion" (variations: initial trochee "TO be," extra unstressed "question").
- L3: "the SLINGS and ARrows OF outRAgeous FORtune" (hypermetric—11 syllables).
**Effect on stance/time:** Meter creates expectation, variation creates meaning. L1's trochaic opening ("TO be") inverts iambic, foregrounding "to." Hypermetric L3 (extra syllable on "outrageous") makes fortune overflow the line—metrically outrageous. Reader hears formal constraint (pentameter) fighting semantic excess.
**Classical kin:** Iambic trimeter (Greek drama), heroic verse.

### **Enjambment** (run-on lines)
**Lines:** L2-3, L4-5
**Signals:**
- L2 "to suffer / The slings"—verb separated from object across line break.
- L4-5 "troubles, / And by opposing"—thought continues without pause.
**Effect on stance:** Forward momentum vs. metrical pause. Reader experiences tension: line-end pause (verse form) conflicts with syntactic flow (meaning). Enjambment = thought too large for metrical container. Hamlet's mind overflows form.
**Classical kin:** Enjambment (Latin: "leg-straddling").

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Monosyllables dominate L1 (8 of 11: "to," "be," "or," "not," "that," "is," "the"). Mouth moves simply, but meaning is monumental—simplicity amplifies weight. L3-4 introduce polysyllables ("outrageous," "opposing"), complicating oral texture as thought complicates.

**Metrical base:** Iambic pentameter (da-DUM × 5). Expected pattern creates anticipation; variations signal meaning:
- L1: "to BE or NOT to BE" = perfect iambs, then trochaic inversion on "THAT is" makes "that" emphatic.
- L2: "WHEther 'TIS" = trochee opening (unstressed-stressed inverted), foregrounding "whether."
- L4: "to TAKE ARMS aGAINST a SEA of TROUbles" = regular iambs until "SEA of TROUbles" (spondee "SEA of" slows, then iamb speeds).

**Caesura:** L1 commas create three breath-units: "To be, | or not to be, | that is the question." Colon after "question" is full stop before expansion. Mid-line pauses (caesurae) in L2-5 allow thinking-pauses:
- L2: "in the mind | to suffer"
- L3: (none—enjambment propels into L4)
- L4: "a sea of troubles, | And by opposing"

**Alliteration:**
- L1: "be...be" (repetition)
- L3-4: "slings...sea" (sibilants); "take...troubles" (plosives)
- L5: "opposing...end...them" (liquid /m/, /n/)
Minimal sonic patterning—Shakespeare avoids ornament, maintains philosophical plainness.

**Rhyme:** None. Blank verse (unrhymed iambic pentameter). Absence of rhyme = absence of closure, resolution.

**Music argues:** Metrical regularity (iambic pentameter) = formal control. Variations (trochaic inversions, hypermetric lines, enjambments) = thought straining against form. Ear hears philosophy trying to break free of verse constraints but failing. Form contains chaos.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Fragmentary infinitive opening + nominal copula ("that is X") + correlative subordinate clause ("Whether...Or...") without main verb. Syntactically incomplete.

**Skeleton:**
- [Infinitive phrase], [copula + noun], [correlative subordinates without resolution].
- No finite main verb governs the whole. Pure subordination without matrix clause.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** High subordination ("Whether..."), but subordinates to nothing. Effect: perpetual suspension. Reader waits for grammatical completion, never arrives. Syntax = existential limbo.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** "outrageous" modifies "fortune" (adjective pre-noun).
- **Postposed:** "of outrageous fortune" modifies "slings and arrows" (prepositional phrase post-noun).
- **Embedded:** "in the mind" (locative) modifies "nobler" (adverb pre-adjective becomes prepositional phrase).
Modification dense, creating syntactic weight.

**Inversion:** Minimal. "Whether 'tis nobler" = "Whether it is nobler" (contraction, not inversion). Mostly SVO order maintained within clauses.

**Information flow:**
- **Given:** "the question" (existential crisis assumed shared knowledge).
- **New:** "to be or not to be" (specific formulation).
- **Focus:** "question" (line-end L1 = stress position).
Topic = existence. Comment = binary choice (be/not-be).

### Micro-rewrites:

**Compressed:** *"To be or not? Should I endure or fight?"*
**Lost:** Infinitive abstraction (becomes first-person), correlative structure, catachresis, metrical frame, philosophical elevation. Gains: clarity, directness. Loses: everything that makes it Shakespeare.

**Dilated:** *"To continue existing in this mortal coil, or to cease to exist entirely—that is the fundamental question which I must now address: whether it would be more noble and dignified, when considered within the confines of rational thought, to endure passively all the terrible misfortunes that an unjust and malevolent fate might hurl against me, symbolically represented as the projectile weapons of military assault, or alternatively, to adopt an active stance of resistance, metaphorically taking up armaments in an attempt—however futile and logically incoherent—to do battle against the overwhelming ocean-like vastness of my tribulations, and through such opposition bring about their termination."*
**Lost:** Velocity, metrical music, compressed power, catachresis's sudden shock. Gains: pedantic exhaustiveness, Victorian flab. Loses: poetry.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Absent/universal. No "I," "here," "now." Infinitives ("to be") float free of person, time, place. Effect: Reader cannot locate speaker—Hamlet erases himself from suicide meditation through grammatical abstraction. But: theatrical context re-anchors—audience sees Hamlet, knows "to be" = his being.

**Aspect:**
- "to be" = infinitive, atelic (unbounded, continuous state).
- "to suffer" = infinitive, durative (continuous endurance).
- "to take" = infinitive, telic (bounded action with completion point).
- "opposing...end" = progressive participle + bare infinitive (ongoing → completion).
Aspectual progression: stative being → durative suffering → telic action → completion. Syntax moves from existence to ending.

**Tense:** No finite verbs except "is" (present copula). Infinitives are tenseless—exist outside time. Effect: Meditation becomes timeless, eternal question. But "is" (present) anchors "question" in now—the asking is immediate.

**Modality:**
- "'tis nobler" = evaluative (moral judgment).
- "Whether" = epistemic (uncertainty about truth).
- No deontic modals ("must," "should")—no obligation stated, only evaluation.
Effect: Question posed as philosophical inquiry, not moral imperative. Reader receives speculation, not command.

**Quoted locus:** "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer" (L2)—"nobler" = comparative adjective making moral claim. "In the mind" localizes nobility to consciousness, not external action. Syntax suggests virtue is mental state, not deed.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Military/combat:** "slings and arrows," "take arms," "opposing"—suffering as warfare.
2. **Oceanic/elemental:** "sea of troubles"—troubles as drowning, overwhelming force.
3. **Fortune/fate:** "fortune" (personified as agent distributing luck/suffering).

**Lexical fields:**
- **Violence cluster:** slings, arrows, arms, opposing, end—vocabulary of combat.
- **Moral/philosophical:** nobler, mind, question—discourse of ethics.
- **Existence:** be, not be—ontological.

**Image logic in one sentence:** Existence reimagined as battlefield where self fights Fortune (personified enemy) using weapons (arms) against liquid element (sea)—category confusions reveal impossibility of meaningful resistance.

**Mixed metaphor as strategy:** "Take arms against a sea"—military + oceanic don't cohere. Reader registers clash. Is this Shakespeare's error? No: catachresis is Hamlet's mental state. Mixing metaphors = confused thinking. Form follows psychology.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** First-person soliloquy, but grammatically third-person (no "I"). Internal monologue disguised as universal meditation. Genette: internal focalization (Hamlet's consciousness) performed as external (abstract philosophy).

**Psychic distance:** Minimal (direct access to thought) yet maximal (thought abstracted from self). Gardner's ladder: paradox—simultaneously #1 (interior monologue) and #7 (philosophical treatise).

**Time (Genette):**
- **Order:** Synchronous (thinking in real-time).
- **Duration:** Scene time ≈ discourse time (5 lines ≈ ~15 seconds of thought).
- **Frequency:** Singulative (one thinking of one question).

**Beat structure:** Proposition ("to be/not be") → identification ("that is the question") → expansion ("Whether...") → accumulation (options pile up) → suspension (no resolution).

**Subtext:** What's unspoken? Suicide. "Not to be" = euphemism. "End them" = end troubles or end self? Ambiguity strategic—can't name the act directly (religious prohibition, Ophelia listening?, self-censorship?). Reader fills gap.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Built through philosophical register. Hamlet performs thinker, not feeler. Vocabulary (nobler, mind, question) = intellectual authority. Reader trusts voice that reasons, not rages. But: trust undermined by mixed metaphor (catachresis)—thinking shown as flawed.

**Pathos:** Affect displaced into metaphor. "Slings and arrows" make suffering vivid; "sea" makes it overwhelming. Reader feels through images, not direct emotional declaration. Restraint (no "I am in agony") amplifies impact.

**Logos:** Pseudo-syllogism: If X is nobler than Y, one should choose X. But: premise never established ("Whether 'tis nobler" = question, not claim). Reader expecting logical proof receives only question-begging. Logic performed, not enacted.

**Lines:** "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer / The slings and arrows" (L2-3)—"in the mind" crucial. Nobility located in consciousness, not action. Hamlet argues suffering becomes noble if mentally framed correctly. Stoic logic.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Senecan tragedy soliloquy:** Roman tragedian's long philosophical speeches by tortured protagonists. Shakespeare inherits rhetorical meditation, compresses into 5 lines (full soliloquy continues 33 lines, but opening is distillation).

**Montaigne's skeptical essays:** "Que sais-je?" (What do I know?) becomes "To be or not to be?" Hamlet as Renaissance skeptic, questioning received truths (including existence itself).

**Medieval/Scholastic disputation:** "Whether it is nobler" = quaestio format (theological debate structure). Shakespeare secularizes

 scholastic question for stage.

**Subversion:** Where medieval disputation reached resolution through logic, Hamlet's never resolves. Where Senecan soliloquy reached decision (usually revenge), Hamlet defers. Syntax of deferral subverts genres of decision.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots:
1. **"To be, or not to be"** (L1)—Irreducible. Existence reduced to three-word infinitive. Most famous line in English. Cultural saturation makes fresh reading nearly impossible, but monosyllabic simplicity retains power.
2. **"take arms against a sea of troubles"** (L4)—Catachresis as philosophy. Mixed metaphor performs impossibility of fighting fate. Reader feels absurdity through grammatical clash.
3. **"And by opposing end them"** (L5)—Ambiguous "them." End troubles? End self? Pronoun ambiguity = suicidal thought's encryption. Reader must choose interpretation.

### Faultlines:
1. **"outrageous fortune"** (L3)—Cliché (even in 1600). "Outrageous" (morally offensive) applied to fortune (amoral) is category error, but less interesting than L4's catachresis. **Fix:** "pitiless fortune" (more precise). **Shift:** Loses personification's moral charge. Current version's slight wrongness works—fortune *shouldn't* be outrageous, but Hamlet makes it so.
2. **"Whether 'tis nobler"** (L2)—Comparative without second term. Nobler than what? **Fix:** "nobler than to resist" (make comparison explicit). **Shift:** Loses Hamlet's elision, his rhetorical slipperiness. Incompleteness is feature—he assumes comparison's second term, revealing bias.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

### Subtraction test:
**Remove:** Catachresis (fix the mixed metaphor)
**Result:** "Or to take arms against an army of troubles"
**Loss:** Impossibility vanishes. "Army" can be fought; "sea" cannot. Metaphor becomes coherent, which is weaker. The wrongness is the strength. Removing catachresis removes Hamlet's recognition of futility.

### Amplification test:
**Heighten:** Add more alternatives (extend correlative)
**Result:** "Whether 'tis nobler...to suffer...Or to take arms...Or to flee...Or to transform them...Or to endure in silence..."
**Gain:** More options = more paralysis (arguably more Hamlet-like). **Risk:** Becomes catalog, not meditation. Two alternatives (passive/active) is perfect balance. More would drag.

### Register shift (formal ↔ colloquial):
**Formal (more):** "To exist, or to negate existence, that constitutes the interrogative: Whether it proves more noble within the rational faculty to undergo passively the projectile weaponry of capricious destiny..."
**Effect:** Latinate abstraction kills immediacy. Over-formalization = academic parody. Loses monosyllabic punch of "to be."

**Colloquial:** "Live or die—that's the question. Should I just take it, all the crap that life throws at me? Or should I fight back against all this trouble, even though it's pointless, and just end it?"
**Effect:** "Take it" and "crap" lower register; "end it" makes suicide explicit. Loses philosophical dignity, metrical music, catachresis's shock. Gains: modern immediacy. Loses: Shakespeare.

### Punctuation swap:
**Comma → Semicolon:** "To be; or not to be; that is the question:"
**Effect:** Semicolons over-separate, making three distinct thoughts instead of one complex thought. Kills the flow, the hesitation. Commas allow breath without breaking unity.

**Colon → Period:** "To be, or not to be, that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler..."
**Effect:** Period makes two sentences, breaking syntactic suspension. Correlative becomes new sentence, suggesting forward movement. Shakespeare's version keeps all suspended in single incomplete thought.

### Focalization nudge:
**Current:** Abstract infinitives (no "I").
**Closer (first-person):** "Should I exist or cease to exist—that's what I'm asking myself. Is it nobler for me to endure..."
**Effect:** Adds "I," making personal. Loses universalizing abstraction. Hamlet's genius is erasing self from suicide meditation through grammar. Personalization weakens philosophical elevation.

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

### Imitatio (new content, same scaffolding):
*To speak, or not to speak, that is the question: / Whether 'tis nobler in the heart to silence / The doubts and terrors of uncertain conscience, / Or to give voice against a wall of judgment, / And by confessing end them.*

**Replicates:** Infinitive binary ("speak/not speak"), copula + "question," "Whether 'tis nobler," catachresis ("give voice against a wall"—can't speak at wall), ambiguous pronoun ("them" = doubts or self?), blank verse pentameter.

### Counter-Imitatio (same content, opposing scaffolding):
*I have to decide. Do I keep living? Or do I kill myself? That's what I'm trying to figure out. Maybe it's better to just accept all the terrible things that happen—the pain, the attacks, everything that life throws at you. Or maybe I should fight. Take action. Try to end all these problems, even though I know it won't work. Even though you can't fight against fate any more than you can stab the ocean.*

**Opposes:** First-person ("I"), present tense finite verbs ("have," "do," "trying"), interrogative sentences (not infinitives), prose (not verse), explicit suicide reference, explanatory aside ("even though"), coherent metaphors (not mixed). Makes implicit explicit. Loses: all poetry.

### Compression (≤25 words):
*To be or not to be—that's the question. Should I endure suffering passively, or fight back and end it all?*

**Keeps:** Binary, "question," passive/active opposition. **Loses:** Infinitive abstraction, catachresis, blank verse, correlative suspension, ambiguous pronoun. Becomes thesis statement, not poetry.

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. **Strip existence to bare infinitives—erase the subject to universalize.** ("To be" not "I am")
2. **Let your metaphors mix impossibly to show futile thinking.** (Take arms against sea = category error = point)
3. **Build correlatives (Whether...Or...) then abandon them—syntax as deferral.** (No resolution)
4. **Use metrical variations to foreground key words.** (Trochaic "TO be" inverts iambic base)
5. **Make pronouns ambiguous when thought is ambiguous.** ("end them" = troubles or self?)
6. **Let enjambment create tension between form and thought.** (Meaning overflows line)
7. **Incomplete syntax = incomplete thinking.** (Aposiopesis enacts paralysis)
