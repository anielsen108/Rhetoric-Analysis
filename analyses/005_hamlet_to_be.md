## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Direct opposition or contrast between ideas.
*Example:* "To be, or not to be"; "to suffer" versus "to take arms"
*Effect:* Dramatizes Hamlet's existential dilemma; creates tension between passive and active responses.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison between unlike things.
*Example:* "slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"; "sea of troubles"
*Effect:* Transforms abstract suffering into concrete military imagery; makes philosophical question visceral.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Substitution of an attribute or associated term for the thing meant.
*Example:* "slings and arrows" for all weapons/attacks; "fortune" for fate or circumstance.
*Effect:* Provides concrete imagery for abstract concepts; makes existential dread tangible.

### **Mixed Metaphor** (mikst MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Combination of incongruous or incompatible metaphors.
*Example:* "Take arms against a sea of troubles"—military action against oceanic force.
*Effect:* Suggests the futility and absurdity of fighting fate; implies irrational desperation.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at the beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "Or to..." repeated in successive lines.
*Effect:* Creates rhythm and emphasizes the alternatives being weighed.

### **Apostrophe** (uh-PAH-struh-fee)
*Definition:* Direct address to an abstract concept.
*Example:* The entire speech addresses the abstract question of existence.
*Effect:* Elevates personal crisis to universal philosophical inquiry.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nif-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Attribution of human qualities to non-human things.
*Example:* "outrageous fortune" (fortune that can offend)
*Effect:* Makes fate seem malevolent and intentional, not random.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Sentence Pattern
The passage opens with a **fragmentary infinitive phrase** that becomes one of the most famous lines in literature. This is followed by a **complex periodic sentence** that suspends its meaning across multiple lines, with the main clause ("that is the question") serving as a hinge, and then an extended **whether...or** construction that remains syntactically incomplete.

### The Opening Fragment
"To be, or not to be"—this is not a complete sentence but an **infinitive phrase balanced against its negative**. The syntax strips existence to its grammatical minimum: the copulative verb "to be" without subject, object, or complement. This grammatical reduction mirrors the philosophical reduction of life to its simplest terms.

### Strategic Use of Punctuation
The comma after "To be" and before "or not to be" creates a **caesura**—a pause that emphasizes the alternatives. Then the colon after "question" signals that what follows will expand or explain. The syntax thus has two movements: compression (to its simplest question), then expansion (into its full implications).

### Parallel Infinitive Constructions
The passage builds on **parallel infinitive phrases**:
- "to suffer"
- "to take arms"
- "(to) opposing"
- "(to) end them"

This parallelism creates what Tufte calls **coordinate alternatives**—grammatically equal choices that structure the philosophical dilemma.

### The "Whether...Or" Structure
This **correlative construction** is left incomplete—we never get the main verb that this subordinate clause should depend on. The syntax enacts Hamlet's inability to complete the thought, to reach resolution. The suspended syntax = the suspended decision.

### Enjambment and Line Breaks
The syntax runs across line boundaries:
- "to suffer / The slings and arrows"
- "troubles, / And by opposing"

This **enjambment** creates forward momentum while the caesuras within lines create hesitation. The syntax performs Hamlet's mental process: rushing forward, then pausing, then continuing.

### Modification Patterns
Notice how the modifiers accumulate:
- Not just "fortune" but "outrageous fortune"
- Not just "slings" but "slings and arrows"
- Not just "troubles" but "a sea of troubles"

Each noun is **amplified by modification**, making the suffering seem overwhelming. The syntax piles up obstacles through cumulative modification.

### The Preposition "Against"
The syntax of "take arms against a sea" is deliberately strained. We can take arms against enemies, but against a sea? The **syntactic awkwardness** mirrors the futility of the action contemplated. The grammar itself argues against the possibility.

### Active vs. Passive Constructions
The syntax embodies the philosophical choice:
- Passive: "to suffer" (to be acted upon)
- Active: "to take arms," "opposing," "end them" (to act)

The grammatical voice reflects the existential alternatives: passive endurance vs. active resistance.

### Verb Density
Note the high concentration of verbs:
- be, be (copulative/existential)
- is (copulative)
- suffer (passive)
- take (active)
- opposing (active participle)
- end (active)

The syntax is **verb-rich**, with verbs of being contrasted against verbs of doing, enacting the dilemma between existence and action.

### Pronoun Ambiguity
"And by opposing end them"—what does "them" refer to? The sea of troubles? The act of taking arms? The syntax is deliberately ambiguous. Can one end troubles by opposing them, or does one end oneself? The syntactic ambiguity preserves the philosophical ambiguity.

### Stylistic Effect
Through suspended syntax, parallel infinitives, and the famous incompleteness of the speech (in the full version, it continues with more alternatives), Shakespeare creates prose that embodies **intellectual paralysis**. The syntax keeps generating alternatives without resolution. This is what Tufte describes as syntax that doesn't just describe thinking but **performs** thinking—we experience Hamlet's indecision through the structure of his sentences. The form is the psychology.
