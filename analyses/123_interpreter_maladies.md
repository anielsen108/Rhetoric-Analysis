## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement.
*Example:* "things they now knew" understates devastating revelations.
*Effect:* Creates restraint that amplifies emotional weight.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "things" for painful secrets.
*Effect:* Maintains Lahiri's characteristic indirection.

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh)
*Definition:* Single verb governing multiple objects differently.
*Example:* "wept...for the things" - physical act for abstract causes.
*Effect:* Connects bodily response to knowledge.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Intransitive Verb
"They wept"—**simple subject-verb**. Syntax reduces complex emotion to essential action.

### Adverbial Togetherness
"together"—**single adverb** emphasizes shared grief. Syntax unites them in sorrow.

### Prepositional Cause
"for the things"—**prepositional phrase** of cause. Syntax makes weeping response to knowledge.

### Relative Clause Knowledge
"they now knew"—**simple relative clause** with temporal adverb. Syntax marks new, present knowledge.

### Vague Demonstrative
"things"—**non-specific noun**. Syntax refuses to name what has been revealed.

### Temporal Marker
"now"—**adverb** emphasizes present moment of knowing. Syntax marks before/after of revelation.

### Stylistic Effect
Through simple subject-verb construction, togetherness adverb, vague "things," and temporal "now," Lahiri creates syntax of restrained devastation—grammar that performs emotional revelation through minimal, understated articulation characteristic of characters who communicate through silence and indirection.
