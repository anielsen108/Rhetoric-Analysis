# Passage 156: "Their Eyes Were Watching God"

## Author and Source
**Zora Neale Hurston**, *Their Eyes Were Watching God* (1937)

## Passage
> Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board. For some they come in with the tide. For others they sail forever on the horizon, never out of sight, never landing until the Watcher turns his eyes away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Ships carrying wishes; dreams as voyages.
*Effect:* Makes desire into maritime journey.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Time "mocking" dreams; ships carrying wishes.
*Effect:* Makes abstract concepts into active agents.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "For some they come in...For others they sail forever"
*Effect:* Divides humanity into those who achieve and those who don't.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "For some...For others"; "never out of sight, never landing"
*Effect:* Creates parallel fates, rhythmic inevitability.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Prepositional Distance
"at a distance"—**spatial preposition**. Syntax establishes remoteness of desire.

### Universal Possessive
"every man's wish"—**universal quantifier** with genitive. Syntax makes claim about all humanity.

### Prepositional Cargo
"on board"—**locative preposition**. Syntax continues nautical metaphor.

### Parallel Benefactives
"For some...For others"—**two parallel prepositional phrases**. Syntax divides humanity into binary outcomes.

### Prepositional Arrival
"with the tide"—**instrumental preposition**. Syntax makes arrival natural, inevitable for fortunate.

### Adverbial Perpetuity
"forever on the horizon"—**time adverb** with spatial location. Syntax traps unfulfilled in permanent near-miss.

### Anaphoric Negation
"never out of sight, never landing"—**two parallel negatives**. Syntax emphasizes cruel proximity without consummation.

### Temporal Subordinate
"until the Watcher turns"—**subordinate clause** with capitalized noun. Syntax makes witness into archetypal figure.

### Prepositional Resignation
"in resignation"—**manner preposition**. Syntax shows how looking away is performed.

### Passive Mockery
"mocked to death by Time"—**past participle** with agent. Syntax makes Time the murderer of dreams.

### Stylistic Effect
Through distant ships bearing universal wishes, parallel benefactive some/others division, perpetual horizon with anaphoric never, capitalized Watcher, and dreams passively mocked to death by personified Time, Hurston creates syntax of philosophical fable—grammar that performs aphoristic wisdom about gendered desire through extended maritime metaphor with biblical cadence.
