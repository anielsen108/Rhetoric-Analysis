# Passage 145: "Around the World in Eighty Days"

## Author and Source
**Jules Verne**, *Around the World in Eighty Days* (1873, translated from French)

## Passage
> Phileas Fogg was one of those mathematically exact people, who, never hurried and always ready, are economical of their steps and their motions.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Oxymoron** (ok-see-MOR-on)
*Definition:* Contradictory terms together.
*Example:* "never hurried and always ready"
*Effect:* Shows Fogg's paradoxical combination of calm and preparedness.

### **Parallelism** (pair-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structures.
*Example:* "never hurried and always ready"; "their steps and their motions"
*Effect:* Creates balanced, methodical rhythm matching character.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Associated term for thing.
*Example:* "steps and motions" for all actions.
*Effect:* Reduces life to mechanical movements.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Copulative Classification
"Phileas Fogg was one of those...people"—**demonstrative pronoun** with genitive. Syntax places character in category.

### Adverbial Precision
"mathematically exact"—**adverb modifying adjective**. Syntax applies mathematical language to human behavior.

### Relative Clause Characterization
"who, never hurried and always ready, are economical"—**non-restrictive relative clause** with embedded participial phrase. Syntax packs multiple defining traits.

### Negative-Positive Pairing
"never hurried and always ready"—**negative with absolute + positive with absolute**. Syntax creates oxymoronic balance.

### Adjectival Economics
"economical of"—**adjective with unusual prepositional object**. Syntax applies financial term to physical movement.

### Possessive Parallel
"their steps and their motions"—**two parallel genitives**. Syntax treats movements as possessions to be conserved.

### Stylistic Effect
Through copulative categorization, mathematical precision adverb, relative clause with oxymoronic never/always pairing, economic conservation of possessed movements, and parallel possessive genitives, Verne creates syntax of mechanical efficiency—grammar that performs Fogg's clockwork nature through balanced, economical construction and mathematical modification.
