## Author and Source

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "not known my father very well"; "got on badly"
*Effect:* Understates profound alienation with British restraint.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "our different fashions" of "shared" vice.
*Effect:* Shows how sameness created division.

### **Oxymoron** (ok-see-MOR-on)
*Definition:* Contradictory terms together.
*Example:* "shared...in our different fashions"
*Effect:* Captures paradox of similar stubbornness creating distance.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Past Perfect Negation
"I had not known"—**past perfect with negation**. Syntax looks back from moment of death to lifetime of estrangement.

### Adverbial Intensifier
"very well"—**adverbial phrase** modifying verb. Understatement through faint praise of knowing.

### Past Perfect with Get
"We had got on badly"—**idiom in past perfect**. British colloquialism suggests long-term dysfunction.

### Causal Clause
"partly because"—**subordinate causal clause** with hedge word "partly." Syntax admits causation while acknowledging complexity.

### Possessive Plural
"our different fashions"—**first person plural possessive** with modifier "different." Syntax links father and son while distinguishing them.

### Appositive Definition
"the vice of stubborn pride"—**noun phrase in apposition** names shared flaw. Syntax makes pride architectural, foundational to estrangement.

### Stylistic Effect
Through past perfect retrospection, understated negation, and paradoxical "shared...different" construction, Baldwin creates syntax of tragic recognition—grammar that sees self in father only after death.
