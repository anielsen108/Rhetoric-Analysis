## Author and Source

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Apostrophe** (uh-PAH-struh-fee)
*Definition:* Direct address to non-human entity.
*Example:* Speaking to flood-tide and clouds.
*Effect:* Makes nature responsive; creates intimacy with natural world.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "I see you face to face" repeated.
*Effect:* Creates incantatory rhythm; emphasizes direct encounter.

### **Exclamation** (ek-skluh-MAY-shun)
*Definition:* Emphatic outcry.
*Example:* "Flood-tide below me!"
*Effect:* Creates enthusiasm and immediacy.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Compound Noun Vocative
"Flood-tide below me!"—**hyphenated compound noun** in vocative case (direct address), followed by **prepositional phrase "below me"** specifying spatial relationship.

### Exclamatory Sentence
The **exclamation point** makes this performative utterance, not mere description. Syntax creates spoken enthusiasm.

### Parallel Structure
"I see you face to face!"—**subject-verb-object-adverbial phrase**. The idiom "face to face" suggests equal, intimate encounter.

### Dash as Syntax
"Clouds of the west—sun there half an hour high—"—**em-dashes** create parenthetical aside within vocative. Syntax interrupts itself to add descriptive detail before continuing address.

### Repeated Pattern
The second sentence mirrors first syntactically, creating **parallel structure**:
- [Vocative], I see you face to face
- [Vocative]—[description]—I see you also face to face

The addition of "also" shows Whitman's democratic vision extending equally to all natural phenomena.

### Stylistic Effect
Through vocatives to nature, exclamatory syntax, and parallel "face to face" encounters, Whitman creates democratic mysticism. Form IS the vision—syntax that addresses tide and clouds as equals, grammar that refuses hierarchy between human and natural world.
