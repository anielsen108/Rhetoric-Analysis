## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of lines.
*Example:* "We" repeated at line beginnings.
*Effect:* Creates defiant rhythm; emphasizes group identity.

### **Enjambment** (en-JAM-ment)
*Definition:* Line break mid-phrase.
*Example:* "We" at end of lines.
*Effect:* Creates syncopated rhythm; mimics jazz.

### **Ellipsis** (ee-LIP-sis)
*Definition:* Omission of words.
*Example:* "We real cool" (missing "are").
*Effect:* Creates vernacular voice; shows dialect.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Subject-Adjective (No Copula)
"We real cool"—**omits copulative verb** "are." This is African American Vernacular English (AAVE) syntax, not error but dialect.

### Line-End Enjambment
"We" placed at **end of lines** rather than beginning creates unusual pause. Syntax through line break makes "We" hover, uncertain.

### Staccato Rhythm
**Short declarative sentences** create drumbeat effect. Syntax is compressed, urgent.

### Stylistic Effect
Through AAVE syntax, enjambed subjects, and staccato rhythm, Brooks creates voice of doomed youth—grammar that performs both bravado and fragility.
