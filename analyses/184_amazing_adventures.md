# Passage 184: "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"

## Author and Source
**Michael Chabon**, *The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay* (2000)

## Passage
> In later years, holding forth to an interviewer or to an audience of aging fans at a comic book convention, Sam Clay liked to declare, apropos of his and Joe Kavalier's greatest creation, that back when he was a boy, sealed and hog-tied inside the airtight vessel known as Brooklyn, New York, he had been haunted by dreams of Harry Houdini.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Brooklyn as "airtight vessel"; childhood as being "sealed and hog-tied"
*Effect:* Makes urban childhood into escape artist's challenge.

### **Allusion** (uh-LOO-zhun)
*Definition:* Reference to other work.
*Example:* Harry Houdini
*Effect:* Invokes escape artist as symbolic liberation figure.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* "sealed and hog-tied inside the airtight vessel"
*Effect:* Overstates childhood confinement for dramatic effect.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Temporal Frame
"In later years"—**temporal prepositional phrase**. Syntax establishes retrospective viewpoint.

### Participial Holding
"holding forth"—**present participle** with idiomatic phrasal verb. Syntax shows Sam in performance mode.

### Prepositional Audience
"to an interviewer or to an audience"—**two parallel datives**. Syntax specifies listeners.

### Genitive Description
"of aging fans"—**possessive phrase**. Syntax characterizes audience.

### Locative Convention
"at a comic book convention"—**spatial preposition**. Syntax anchors performance to specific venue.

### Declarative Liking
"Sam Clay liked to declare"—**cognitive verb** with infinitive complement. Syntax shows habitual claim.

### Parenthetical Apropos
"apropos of his and Joe Kavalier's greatest creation"—**French phrase** with coordinated possessives. Syntax adds formal, self-conscious connection.

### Temporal Subordinate
"that back when he was a boy"—**compound temporal clause**. Syntax introduces nested memory.

### Participial Sealing
"sealed and hog-tied"—**two past participles** coordinated. Syntax shows double restraint.

### Prepositional Containment
"inside the airtight vessel known as Brooklyn, New York"—**spatial preposition** with metaphor and formal address. Syntax makes borough into escape chamber.

### Passive Haunting
"he had been haunted"—**passive past perfect**. Syntax makes dreams external force acting on child.

### Stylistic Effect
Through temporal later-years frame, participial holding-forth performance, parenthetical apropos formal connection, nested temporal back-when subordination, coordinated sealed-and-hog-tied participles, metaphorical airtight-vessel Brooklyn, and passive been-haunted dreams, Chabon creates syntax of retrospective myth-making—grammar that shows protagonist constructing origin story through layered temporal frames and escape-artist metaphors.
