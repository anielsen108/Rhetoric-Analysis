## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Inversion** (in-VER-zhun)
*Definition:* Reversal of normal word order.
*Example:* "Whose woods these are" instead of "I think I know whose woods these are."
*Effect:* Emphasizes the woods and ownership question; creates formal, slightly archaic tone.

### **Enjambment** (en-JAM-ment)
*Definition:* Continuation of sentence across line breaks.
*Example:* "He will not see me stopping here / To watch"
*Effect:* Creates forward momentum while maintaining metrical structure.

### **Understatement** (UN-der-state-ment)
*Definition:* Deliberate restraint in expression.
*Example:* The casual, conversational tone for what's actually a profound moment.
*Effect:* Creates characteristically Frostian combination of simplicity and depth.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Inversion
"Whose woods these are I think I know"—the syntax inverts normal order (I think I know whose woods these are). This **fronting** of the noun clause emphasizes the woods and the question of ownership. The **parenthetical "I think"** creates uncertainty—he thinks he knows, but isn't certain.

### Adversative Conjunction
"His house is in the village though"—the **conjunction "though"** at line end creates tension. The owner is absent, which both explains why the speaker can stop and creates slight guilt about trespassing.

### Future Tense Negative
"He will not see me stopping here"—the **future negative** expresses certainty about remaining unseen. The present participle "stopping" emphasizes the action's duration.

### Infinitive of Purpose
"To watch his woods fill up with snow"—the **infinitive phrase** expresses purpose. The syntax uses "watch" + object + infinitive ("fill up"), creating a sense of patient observation. The phrasal verb "fill up" makes the process gradual, observable.

### Stylistic Effect
Through syntactic inversion, simple diction, and conversational tone, Frost creates deceptively simple poetry. The syntax performs the poem's theme: appearing casual while containing depths. The inverted opening and the qualification "I think" create uncertainty within seemingly certain statements—characteristic of Frost's philosophical ambiguity embedded in plain syntax.
