## Passage

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "The princess...The man"
*Effect:* Creates incantatory rhythm; emphasizes narrative structure.

### **Parataxis** (pair-uh-TAK-sis)
*Definition:* Clauses without connectives.
*Example:* Three separate sentences placed adjacently.
*Effect:* Fragments suggest disconnection; narratives don't cohere.

### **Allusion** (uh-LOO-zhun)
*Definition:* Reference to other texts/stories.
*Example:* Fairy tale elements (princess, candy man).
*Effect:* Evokes narrative archetypes we use to structure reality.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Purpose Clause
"in order to live"—**infinitive phrase of purpose**. Syntax makes storytelling existentially necessary.

### First Person Plural
"We tell ourselves"—**subject with reflexive pronoun**. Syntax emphasizes self-narration, not external stories.

### Passive in Metaphor
"princess is caged"—**passive construction** in fairy tale fragment. Syntax shows story as given, not chosen.

### Future Tense Threat
"will lead the children"—**simple future** in sinister story. Syntax makes narrative predictive, ominous.

### Paratactic Juxtaposition
Three declarative sentences with no connection. **No coordinating or subordinating conjunctions**. Syntax fragments narrative coherence even while asserting need for stories.

### Stylistic Effect
Through purpose clause establishing existential need, first person plural reflexive, and paratactic fragmentation that contradicts coherence, Didion creates syntax of narrative collapse—grammar that asserts storytelling's necessity while demonstrating its failure.
