# Passage 095: "Politics and the English Language"

## Author and Source
**George Orwell**, *Horizon* (1946)

## Passage
> The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Language as enemy; writer as cuttlefish.
*Effect:* Makes abstraction concrete; shows language as defensive mechanism.

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* "like a cuttlefish spurting out ink"
*Effect:* Visualizes obfuscation as natural defense; makes obscurity biological.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Language has "enemy"
*Effect:* Makes linguistic corruption active agent.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Copulative Definition
"The great enemy...is insincerity"—**subject-copula-complement**. Syntax creates definitional statement with definite articles establishing identification.

### Temporal Subordinate Clause
"When there is a gap"—**subordinate temporal/conditional clause**. Syntax establishes condition under which obfuscation occurs.

### Genitive Opposition
"between one's real and one's declared aims"—**two possessive phrases** in opposition. Syntax parallels the split between authenticity and performance.

### Impersonal Pronoun
"one turns"—**impersonal pronoun** makes this universal observation. Syntax generalizes rather than accuses.

### Hedging Parenthetical
"as it were"—**parenthetical phrase** that hedges the metaphor. Syntax admits figurative nature while maintaining point.

### Adverbial Manner
"instinctively"—**adverb of manner** suggests unconscious process. Syntax makes obfuscation automatic, not deliberate.

### Final Simile
"like a cuttlefish spurting out ink"—**prepositional phrase of comparison** with present participle. Syntax ends with vivid image that crystallizes abstract argument.

### Stylistic Effect
Through definitional copula, temporal condition, impersonal pronoun, and culminating animal simile, Orwell creates syntax of diagnostic clarity—grammar that performs the transparent prose it advocates.
