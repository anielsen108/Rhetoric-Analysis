# Passage 160: Refusing to Feel (*Native Son*)

**Richard Wright** · *Native Son* · 1940 | Book One, "Fear"

**Occasion/Pressure:** Bigger Thomas recognizes that acknowledging Black suffering could overwhelm him; sentence articulates survival through emotional suppression.
**Persona/Stance:** Close third-person limited—Bigger's consciousness rendered with analytic clarity.
**Thesis of Effect:** Knowledge verbs, reflexive control, and passive catastrophe clauses show how awareness threatens to sweep Bigger out of himself.

## PASSAGE

[L1] He knew that the moment he allowed himself to feel to its fullness how they lived, the shame and misery of their lives, he would be swept out of himself with fear and despair.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for / ˈmɛtəfɔːr)
**Evidence:** "swept out of himself."
**Effect:** Emotions imagined as tidal force ejecting identity.

### **Hendiadys** (hen-DY-uh-dis / hɛnˈdaɪədɪs)
**Evidence:** "fear and despair."
**Effect:** Paired nouns amplify singular overwhelming terror.

### **Apposition** (ap-uh-ZIH-shun / ˌæpəˈzɪʃən)
**Evidence:** "how they lived, the shame and misery…"
**Effect:** Names the content of life in blunt emotional terms.

### **Hyperbaton (inversion)**
**Evidence:** Placing "the shame and misery of their lives" between clauses.
**Effect:** Suspends reader in the painful detail before consequence.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Subordinate Clause Nesting**
**Evidence:** "He knew that the moment… he allowed…"
**Effect:** Multiple layers capture complexity of mental guardrails.

### **Reflexive Construction**
**Evidence:** "allowed himself."
**Effect:** Emphasizes self-regulation; feeling requires permission.

### **Indirect Question**
**Evidence:** "how they lived."
**Effect:** Converts social condition into object of potential feeling.

### **Passive Modal**
**Evidence:** "would be swept."
**Effect:** Highlights loss of agency once feelings unleashed.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Cognitive Frame**
**Signals:** "He knew that…"
**Effect:** Sentence anchored in knowledge; fear arises from anticipation, not event.

### **Temporal Trigger**
**Signals:** "the moment."
**Effect:** Defines razor-thin boundary between repression and collapse.

### **Instrumental Preposition**
**Signals:** "with fear and despair."
**Effect:** Emotions function as tools of destruction wielded by oppressive reality.

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Sibilants (shame, misery, swept) hiss; hard k in "knew" anchors opening.

**Cadence seams:** Commas create cascading clauses; last phrase drops like verdict.

**Alliteration:** "feel…fullness" f-sounds highlight intensity.

**Music argues:** Sentence builds tension then releases in the sweeping final clause.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Complex sentence with main clause + nested temporal and conditional clauses.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** Cognitive main clause first.
- **Mid:** Temporal clause "the moment…"
- **Postposed:** Consequence clause "he would be swept…"

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Pure hypotaxis; no coordination.

**Information flow:** Knowledge → potential permission → full perception of oppression → catastrophic outcome.

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"He knew that if he ever fully felt how they lived—their shame and misery—fear would sweep him away."* — Clear but loses hypnotic cascade.
- **Dilated:** *"He understood that at the instant he let himself feel, in its total weight, the way they lived—their shame, their misery—fear and despair would hurl him out of himself."* — Preserves meaning with more emphasis.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Bigger's perspective; "they" refers to Black community.

**Aspect:** Simple past for knowledge; modal future (would) for feared outcome.

**Modality:** "would" signals hypothetical yet certain consequence.

**Temporal logic:** Single "moment" triggers irreversible sweep.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Flood/force:** Swept out of self.
2. **Emotional weight:** Shame, misery.

**Lexical fields:** Knowledge, permission, feeling, catastrophe.

**Image logic:** Awareness equals exposure to flood; repression prevents drowning.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Deep interior monologue of Bigger.

**Time:** Reflective pause explaining his avoidance strategies.

**Beat structure:** Knowledge → potential action → description of suffering → predicted collapse.

**Subtext:** Emotional numbness as survival mechanism within racial oppression.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Narrator articulates Bigger's intelligence; he perceives consequences of empathy.

**Pathos:** Reader feels tragedy of necessary numbness.

**Logos:** Conditional logic shows cause (full feeling) → effect (psychic destruction).

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Naturalist psychology** akin to Dreiser, but with racial focus.

**Existential dread** anticipating Camus/Sartre.

**African American protest literature** exposing internal cost of oppression.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"allowed himself"** — conscious repression.
2. **"shame and misery"** — blunt naming.
3. **"swept out of himself"** — catastrophic metaphor.

### Faultlines
1. **Potential fatalism:** Suggests inevitability; later narrative complicates.
2. **Heavy clause stacking** may challenge readers; purposeful to convey burden.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove appositive phrase—sentence becomes abstract; loses social specificity.

**Amplification test:** Add "daily" before "shame"—heightens immediacy but risks redundancy.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"He understood that the instant he permitted himself…"*
- **Colloquial:** *"He knew if he ever let himself really feel how they lived…"*

**Punctuation swap:** Replace commas with em dashes around appositive—could increase punch but disrupt flow.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *She knew that the moment she let the hospital smells into her heart, the stale bleach and sobbing, she’d be swept out of herself with grief.*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *He knew that if he felt how they lived he would be afraid.* — Flat, no cascade.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *He knew that if he let himself fully feel how they lived—the shame and misery—fear and despair would sweep him out of himself.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Open with "He knew" to ground sentence in cognition.
2. Use "the moment" to dramatize fragile threshold.
3. Pair reflexive verbs with infinitives to show self-control.
4. Insert appositive naming oppression before consequence.
5. Employ passive modals to emphasize loss of agency.
6. End with instrumental preposition to show emotions as weapon.
7. Let clause accumulation mimic weight of social reality.
