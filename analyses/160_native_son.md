# Passage 160: "Native Son"

## Author and Source
**Richard Wright**, *Native Son* (1940)

## Passage

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Hendiadys** (hen-DY-uh-dis)
*Definition:* Two nouns for single complex idea.
*Example:* "fear and despair"
*Effect:* Separates intertwined emotions into components.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Emotions "sweeping" him "out of himself"
*Effect:* Makes feeling into drowning, overwhelming force.

### **Polysyndeton** (pah-lee-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Many conjunctions.
*Example:* "feel...how they lived, the shame and misery"
*Effect:* Accumulates unbearable awareness.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Epistemic Verb
"He knew"—**cognitive verb**. Syntax presents awareness as certain knowledge.

### Nominal Clause Object
"that the moment he allowed"—**subordinate clause** as direct object. Syntax makes complex understanding the known thing.

### Temporal Noun
"the moment"—**temporal noun** marking instant. Syntax pinpoints dangerous threshold.

### Reflexive Permission
"he allowed himself"—**reflexive construction**. Syntax shows active self-denial, conscious repression.

### Infinitive Feeling
"to feel"—**infinitive** as complement. Syntax makes feeling voluntary action.

### Prepositional Fullness
"to its fullness"—**extent preposition**. Syntax measures depth of potential feeling.

### Interrogative Clause
"how they lived"—**indirect question** as object. Syntax embeds conditions of life in feeling-object.

### Appositive Specification
"the shame and misery of their lives"—**appositive phrase** specifying "how they lived". Syntax names what must not be felt.

### Passive Conditional
"he would be swept out"—**modal passive** in consequence clause. Syntax shows loss of control.

### Prepositional Instrument
"with fear and despair"—**instrumental preposition**. Syntax makes emotions the sweeping force.

### Stylistic Effect
Through epistemic knowing, temporal moment-threshold, reflexive self-permission, infinitive feeling, fullness extent, interrogative how-they-lived, appositive shame-and-misery, modal passive sweeping, and instrumental fear-despair, Wright creates syntax of survival through disconnection—grammar showing how Bigger must actively deny feeling to avoid psychological annihilation by oppressive reality.
