# Passage 064: Meditations

## Author and Source
**Marcus Aurelius**, *Meditations* (translated by Gregory Hays, c. 170-180 CE), Book II

## Passage
> You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "your mind" vs. "outside events"
*Effect:* Creates clear philosophical distinction; establishes Stoic principle.

### **Imperative** (im-PAIR-uh-tiv)
*Definition:* Command form.
*Example:* "Realize this"
*Effect:* Makes philosophy practical instruction; creates direct relationship with reader.

### **Parallelism** (par-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structures.
*Example:* "power over your mind—not outside events"
*Effect:* Creates balance that emphasizes the opposition.

### **Consequence Structure** (KON-suh-kwens STRUK-chur)
*Definition:* If-then logical relationship.
*Example:* "Realize this, and you will find strength"
*Effect:* Makes philosophy conditional promise; realization leads to strength.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Statement
"You have power over your mind"—**subject-verb-object-prepositional phrase**. The **second person "You"** makes this direct address. The **present tense "have"** states current fact, not future possibility.

The **object "power"** modified by **prepositional phrase "over your mind"** specifies the domain of control.

### Negative Contrast
"not outside events"—the **dash** introduces contrasting element. The **negative "not"** + **adjective "outside"** + **noun "events"** creates the crucial Stoic distinction.

The **elliptical syntax** omits verb: [you have power] not [over] outside events. This compression creates emphasis through omission.

### Imperative Sentence
"Realize this"—**imperative verb** + **demonstrative pronoun**. The syntax shifts from statement (you have power) to command (realize). From description to prescription.

### Coordinate Consequence
"and you will find strength"—the **coordinating conjunction** links realization to result. The **future tense "will find"** promises consequence.

The **verb "find"** (not "have" or "gain") suggests discovery of something already present. The syntax through verb choice suggests strength exists, waiting to be found.

### Two-Sentence Structure
The passage divides into:
1. Philosophical principle (statement + contrast)
2. Practical instruction (command + promise)

This **syntactic movement** from theory to practice is characteristic of Stoic writing.

### Stylistic Effect
Through antithesis, imperative mood, and conditional promise, Marcus Aurelius creates syntax of practical philosophy. The form performs Stoic principle: clear statement, clear distinction, clear instruction. Grammar as wisdom literature—syntax that doesn't ornament but instructs directly.
