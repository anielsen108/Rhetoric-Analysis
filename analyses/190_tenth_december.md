## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to surface.
*Example:* Boy thinks he looks "b.a." (badass) in oversized coat.
*Effect:* Shows gap between self-perception and reality.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "unfortunate prince valiant bangs" for bad haircut.
*Effect:* Uses elevated language for childhood awkwardness.

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh)
*Definition:* Verb governing different objects.
*Example:* Boy both "hulked" and "requisitioned"
*Effect:* Mixes physical action with bureaucratic language.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Definite Boy
"The pale boy"—**definite article** making child universal type. Syntax presents as familiar figure.

### Prepositional Attributes
"with unfortunate prince valiant bangs and cublike mannerisms"—**two coordinated genitives**. Syntax accumulates unflattering descriptors.

### Adjectival Unfortunate
"unfortunate"—**euphemistic adjective**. Syntax softens harsh judgment.

### Compound Cultural
"prince valiant"—**lowercase cultural reference** as adjective. Syntax assumes reader knows medieval comic character.

### Neologistic Cub
"cublike"—**compound adjective**. Syntax makes animal comparison.

### Incongruous Hulked
"hulked to the mudroom closet"—**large-motion verb** for small boy. Syntax creates comic mismatch.

### Bureaucratic Requisitioned
"requisitioned Dad's white coat"—**formal military verb** for borrowing. Syntax elevates childhood action.

### Copulative Cool
"He looked b.a. in it"—**copula** with abbreviation. Syntax uses slang from boy's perspective.

### Temporal Moment
"for a moment"—**brief temporal phrase**. Syntax shows fleeting confidence.

### Adverbial Even
"even thought about"—**intensifier** with cognitive verb. Syntax emphasizes how extreme fantasy was.

### Participial Wearing
"wearing it to school"—**gerund** as thought-object. Syntax completes impossible fantasy.

### Stylistic Effect
Through definite pale-boy typing, prepositional unfortunate/cublike accumulation, incongruous hulked-and-requisitioned verbs mixing physical and bureaucratic, copulative looked-b.a. self-delusion, temporal for-a-moment brevity, and adverbial even-thought fantasy, Saunders creates syntax of adolescent grandiosity—grammar that shows boy's self-mythologizing through language mismatch between reality (pale, cub-like) and imagination (hulking, requisitioning, badass).
