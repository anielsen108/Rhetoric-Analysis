## Author and Source

## Passage

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Expression of meaning through language that signifies the opposite.
*Example:* The entire sentence—presenting a social prejudice as universal truth.
*Effect:* Establishes the novel's satirical tone; undermines the certainty the sentence claims.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Deliberate exaggeration for emphasis.
*Example:* "universally acknowledged"
*Effect:* Satirizes the provincial certainty of the society being depicted; suggests the limitation of their worldview.

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus) / **Antimetabole** (an-ti-meh-TAB-uh-lee)
*Definition:* Reversal of grammatical structures in successive phrases.
*Example:* The inverted relationship between possession (of fortune) and want (of wife).
*Effect:* Creates elegant balance while highlighting the mercenary nature of the social assumption.

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh)
*Definition:* Use of a word to modify two or more words when appropriate to only one.
*Example:* The verb "must be" links the formal "in possession of" with the more emotional "in want of."
*Effect:* Subtly equates economic status with emotional desire, critiquing the society's conflation of the two.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Sentence Pattern
This is a **periodic sentence** par excellence—the meaning is suspended until the very end. The sentence structure forces us to wait for "must be in want of a wife," building anticipation and then delivering what should be a logical conclusion but is actually a social satire.

### Syntactic Structure
The sentence follows the pattern:
**Subject + Complement + Relative Clause + Modal Verb Phrase**

The formal opening "It is a truth" creates distance and objectivity, while the passive construction removes agency—no one acknowledges this truth, it simply "is acknowledged." This **impersonal construction** is crucial to the irony.

### Strategic Use of Formality
Austen employs **elevated diction** and **formal syntax** to mock the pretensions of her society. The Latinate phrase "universally acknowledged" and the formal "that" clause create a tone of philosophical or legal certainty—which makes the trivial content more ridiculous.

### Grammatical Balance
The sentence demonstrates perfect **syntactic balance**:
- "in possession of a good fortune"
- "in want of a wife"

Both phrases use the same prepositional structure ("in [noun] of [noun phrase]"), creating symmetry that suggests equivalence between fortune and wife, possession and want.

### Modal Auxiliary
The use of "must be" is crucial—it expresses logical necessity, suggesting that possession of fortune naturally leads to wanting a wife. This modal choice presents social convention as logical inevitability.

### Syntactic Irony
The syntax itself performs irony. The **formal, elevated structure** traditionally used for profound truths is here applied to marriage-market economics. The gap between syntactic register and semantic content creates the satirical effect.

### Embedded Assumptions
Note how the syntax embeds assumptions through modification: not just "a man" but "a single man"; not just "fortune" but "a good fortune"; not just any desire but a specific "want of a wife." Each modifier narrows the focus while appearing to simply describe, revealing the specificity of this supposedly "universal" truth.

### Stylistic Effect
Through syntax alone, Austen establishes her novel's dual nature: she can speak in the voice of her society (formal, assured, conventional) while simultaneously undermining it. The reader who perceives the irony shares Austen's superior perspective; the reader who doesn't becomes part of what she satirizes.
