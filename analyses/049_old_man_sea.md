# Passage 049: The Old Man and the Sea

## Author and Source
**Ernest Hemingway**, *The Old Man and the Sea* (1952)

## Passage
> He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Understatement** (UN-der-state-ment)
*Definition:* Deliberate restraint in expression.
*Example:* The matter-of-fact tone for describing devastating failure.
*Effect:* Creates Hemingway's characteristic stoic style; implies dignity in suffering.

### **Specificity** (spes-ih-FIS-ih-tee)
*Definition:* Use of precise details.
*Example:* "eighty-four days"—exact number, not "many days"
*Effect:* Creates documentary realism; makes failure measurable, concrete.

### **Polysyndeton** (pol-ee-SIN-duh-ton)
*Definition:* Multiple conjunctions.
*Example:* "and he had gone"—extra "and" where period might work
*Effect:* Creates linking of facts; accumulates information without hierarchy.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Subject with Relative Clause
"He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream"—the **relative clause** "who fished..." defines the man through his action. The syntax makes identity = occupation.

The **three prepositional phrases** stack:
- "alone" (condition)
- "in a skiff" (method)
- "in the Gulf Stream" (location)

Each adds specificity without subordination—classic Hemingway accumulation through coordination.

### Coordinate Independent Clause
"and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish"—the **coordinating conjunction "and"** could be a period, making two sentences. Hemingway chooses coordination, linking identity (fisherman) directly to failure (no fish).

### Past Perfect
"had gone"—the **past perfect tense** emphasizes duration leading to present moment. The failure has been ongoing.

### Precise Duration
"eighty-four days"—the **cardinal number** is exact, not rounded. This specificity creates realism and emphasizes how long he's been counting.

### Temporal Adverb
"now"—this **adverb** makes past perfect connect to present. The syntax bridges time: it has been going on and continues up to this moment.

### Negative Gerund Phrase
"without taking a fish"—the **negative prepositional phrase** with gerund expresses what hasn't happened. The verb "taking" (not "catching") is precise fisherman's term.

The syntax uses singular "a fish" (not "any fish" or "fish")—he hasn't caught even ONE.

### Sentence as Complete Profile
The single sentence creates complete portrait: who (old man), what (fishes), how (alone), where (skiff, Gulf Stream), and current situation (84 days no fish). The syntax compresses biography into one economical statement.

### Stylistic Effect
Through precise numbers, stacked prepositional phrases, and matter-of-fact tone, Hemingway creates his signature sparse, powerful syntax. The form performs the code: no complaint, no self-pity, just facts. The 84 days of failure stated as simply as weather report. This is syntax as stoicism—grammar that refuses to dramatize, making dignity through restraint.
