## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Neologism** (nee-AHL-oh-jiz-um)
*Definition:* Invented word.
*Example:* "engirth," "discorrupt"
*Effect:* Creates words for concepts that don't have them; expands English's expressive capacity.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Body as electrical device; soul as electric charge.
*Effect:* Fuses physical and spiritual through technological metaphor.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* Implied "I" beginning multiple clauses.
*Effect:* Creates insistent first-person presence; makes self central.

### **Polysyndeton** (pol-ee-SIN-duh-ton)
*Definition:* Multiple conjunctions.
*Example:* "and I engirth them...and charge them"
*Effect:* Creates rolling, accumulating rhythm; suggests abundance.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Declaration
"I sing the body electric"—**subject-verb-object** with remarkable object: "the body electric." The **adjective following noun** (French word order) makes "electric" more emphatic, almost a title.

The verb "sing" (not "describe" or "celebrate") makes this poetic act, not prose explanation. The syntax claims bardic authority.

### Subject-Verb Chiasmus
"The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them"—creates **chiastic structure**:
- armies...engirth me
- I engirth them

The syntax reverses subject and object, suggesting reciprocal action, mutual encirclement.

### Invented Verb
"engirth"—Whitman **coins verb** from "girth" (to encircle). The syntax needs no quotation marks or explanation—it simply uses the word as if it exists, forcing it into existence.

### Negative Until Clause
"They will not let me off till I go with them"—the **negative construction** with **temporal clause** creates compulsion. The syntax makes the relationship necessary, not chosen—they won't release him until he complies.

### Triple Infinitives
"go with them, respond to them, / And discorrupt them, and charge them"—series of **infinitive phrases**:
- go with them (accompaniment)
- respond to them (reciprocity)
- discorrupt them (purification)
- charge them (transmission of energy)

The syntax accumulates obligations, each building on previous.

### Second Neologism
"discorrupt"—another **invented word**, this time using prefix "dis-" (reversing) + "corrupt." The syntax creates antonym for corrupt by adding reversing prefix, suggesting he can undo corruption.

### Parallel Prepositional Phrases
"charge them full with the charge of the soul"—uses **noun "charge"** as both verb and noun in same clause. The syntax creates wordplay: electrical charge becomes spiritual charge. The prepositional phrase "of the soul" makes the metaphor explicit.

### Enjambment
Lines **run over without pause**, creating breathless, enthusiastic forward movement. The syntax refuses to pause at line breaks, pushing forward like the electric current described.

### Stylistic Effect
Through neologisms, parallel structures, and electrical metaphor embedded in syntax, Whitman creates revolutionary democratic poetry. The form performs the content: if English lacks words for his vision, syntax will CREATE words. If standard meter constrains, he'll break it. This is syntax as manifesto—grammar itself democratized, opened to new possibilities, charged with new energy. Tufte's principle radicalized: syntax not just as style but as linguistic revolution.
