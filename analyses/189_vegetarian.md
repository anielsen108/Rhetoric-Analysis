# Passage 189: Ordinary No More (*The Vegetarian*)

**Han Kang** · *The Vegetarian* · 2007 (trans. Deborah Smith, 2015) | Opening lines

**Occasion/Pressure:** Husband narrates pre-transformation expectations to frame shock of wife’s vegetarianism.
**Persona/Stance:** Detached, self-satisfied male narrator confessing indifference.
**Thesis of Effect:** Temporal framing, totalizing adjectives, and blunt negations display his emotional vacancy while inviting reader distrust.

---

## PASSAGE

[L1] Before my wife turned vegetarian, I'd always thought of her as completely unremarkable in every way.
[L2] To be frank, the first time I met her I wasn't even attracted to her.

---

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Hyperbole**
**Evidence:** "completely unremarkable in every way."
**Effect:** Overstates ordinariness, revealing narrator’s arrogance.

### **Litotes**
**Evidence:** "wasn't even attracted."
**Effect:** Understates attraction to emphasize lack.

### **Irony**
**Evidence:** Reader knows transformation will contradict his assessment.
**Effect:** Sets up dramatic reversal.

### **Metonymy of appetite**
**Evidence:** Vegetarianism stands for entire change.
**Effect:** Food choice becomes shorthand for rebellion.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Temporal subordination**
**Evidence:** "Before my wife turned vegetarian."
**Effect:** Marks clear before/after boundary.

### **Past perfect habitual**
**Evidence:** "I'd always thought."
**Effect:** Shows entrenched viewpoint.

### **Adverbial intensifiers**
**Evidence:** "completely," "in every way," "even."
**Effect:** Pushes judgments to extremes.

### **Infinitive disclosure**
**Evidence:** "To be frank."
**Effect:** Signals confessional aside while masking casual cruelty.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Confessional minimalism**
**Signals:** Two sentences of plain diction.
**Effect:** Cold tone underscores emotional absence.

### **Evaluative copulas**
**Signals:** "thought of her as…"; "wasn't…attracted."
**Effect:** Reduces wife to assessments.

### **Sequential framing**
**Signals:** Sentence one sets context; sentence two revisits first encounter.
**Effect:** Provides evidence for judgment.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Flat vowels and hard consonants mimic dismissive tone.

**Cadence:** First sentence long and level; second shorter but clipped by "wasn't even."

**Music:** Unadorned rhythm mirrors narrator’s monotony.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:**
- L1: Subordinate clause + main clause with predicate complement.
- L2: Infinitive phrase opener → temporal clause → negative copular clause.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** Temporal "Before" and "To be frank" prime perspective.
- **Mid:** Intensifier "completely" loads predicate.
- **Postposed:** "in every way" universalizes; "even" heightens negation.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Subordination front-loaded; no coordination.

**Information flow:** Establish timeline → express entrenched view → justify with anecdote → confess lack of desire.

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"I always thought my wife was ordinary and I wasn’t attracted to her."* — Lacks smug cadence.
- **Dilated:** *"Before my wife ever swore off meat, I had long regarded her as utterly unremarkable in every conceivable respect; frankly, even at our first meeting she stirred no attraction in me whatsoever."* — Maintains disdain with richer texture.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deixis:** "my wife" personal yet possessive; no names given.

**Aspect:** Past perfect indicates enduring perspective; simple past for first meeting.

**Modality:** None—statements presented as fact, revealing certainty.

**Temporal logic:** Narrative rooted in recollection before dramatic change.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:** None overt; emphasis on evaluation language.

**Lexical fields:** Domesticity, perception, attraction.

**Image logic:** Wife depicted as object lacking qualities until rebellion.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** First-person husband controlling early narrative.

**Time:** Retrospective summary prior to inciting incident.

**Beat structure:** Before-state description → initial encounter confession.

**Subtext:** Patriarchal expectations; hints at oppressive marriage dynamic.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Narrator claims honesty via "To be frank."

**Pathos:** Generates reader sympathy for wife by showing husband’s coldness.

**Logos:** Presents cause (perceived ordinariness) for later shock.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Unreliable narrators:** Resonates with Nabokov’s Humbert in self-justification.

**Domestic disquiet:** Aligns with Murakami’s cool male narrators confronting change.

**Feminist critique:** Echoes Atwood’s depiction of male gaze misreading women.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"Before my wife turned vegetarian"** — sets transformation boundary.
2. **"completely unremarkable in every way"** — reveals narrator’s hyperbole.
3. **"To be frank"** — faux candor exposing cruelty.

### Faultlines
- Narrator’s bias undermines credibility.
- Lack of wife’s perspective invites reader skepticism.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove "in every way"—statement softens, losing totalizing arrogance.

**Amplification test:** Add physical description—could show objectifying gaze but might slow brisk opening.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"Prior to my wife’s adoption of vegetarianism, I regarded her as devoid of distinguishing characteristics."*
- **Colloquial:** *"Before she went veggie, I figured she was nothing special, honestly didn’t even feel a spark when we first met."*

**Punctuation swap:** Insert comma after "To be frank"—adds brief pause, heightens confession tone (already implied).

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *Before my husband took up painting, I had always considered him forgettable. Honestly, that first blind date sparked zero interest.*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *My wife became vegetarian. I didn’t like it.* — Misses dismissive texture.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *Before she turned vegetarian I’d always thought her totally unremarkable; frankly, even at our first meeting I wasn’t attracted to her.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Start with "Before" clause to set transformation arc.
2. Use past perfect to show entrenched judgments.
3. Pile intensifiers to reveal narrator’s absolutism.
4. Deploy faux-confessional phrase to expose bias.
5. Pair evaluation with anecdote for credibility.
6. Keep diction plain to highlight emotional void.
7. Signal unreliability through overconfidence.
