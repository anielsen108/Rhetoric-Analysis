## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "wasn't even attracted to her"
*Effect:* Emphasizes emotional absence through double negative.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* "completely unremarkable in every way"
*Effect:* Overstates wife's ordinariness to husband.

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to surface.
*Example:* Husband's assessment proves catastrophically wrong.
*Effect:* Opens novel with narrator's complete misunderstanding.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Temporal Subordinate
"Before my wife turned vegetarian"—**temporal conjunction** with intransitive verb. Syntax marks transformation moment.

### Past Perfect Thinking
"I'd always thought of her"—**past perfect** with adverb. Syntax shows prior continuous belief.

### Adverbial Totality
"always"—**universal time adverb**. Syntax emphasizes unbroken assessment.

### Copulative Judgment
"as completely unremarkable"—**comparative preposition** with intensified adjective. Syntax makes extreme ordinariness claim.

### Prepositional Scope
"in every way"—**universal spatial metaphor**. Syntax makes judgment total.

### Parenthetical Honesty
"To be frank"—**infinitive of purpose** signaling confession. Syntax marks uncomfortable admission.

### Temporal First Time
"the first time I met her"—**definite temporal clause**. Syntax recalls initial encounter.

### Negative Passive
"I wasn't even attracted to her"—**negative copula** with intensifier. Syntax emphasizes absence through double negation.

### Stylistic Effect
Through temporal before-wife-turned subordination, past perfect always-thought prior state, copulative completely-unremarkable totality, universal in-every-way scope, parenthetical to-be-frank confession, temporal first-time recall, and negative wasn't-even-attracted double-negation, Han creates syntax of husbandly dismissal—grammar that opens with narrator's contemptuous assessment of wife as utterly ordinary and unattractive, establishing dramatic irony as vegetarianism will prove her radically otherwise.
