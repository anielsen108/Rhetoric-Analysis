## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Dog arriving with agency "by sea"
*Effect:* Makes pet's arrival mythic, heroic.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Associated term for thing.
*Example:* "sea" for ship or maritime journey.
*Effect:* Elevates prosaic travel to elemental force.

### **Hendiadys** (hen-DY-uh-dis)
*Definition:* Two descriptions for one thing.
*Example:* Both "child Clara" and her "delicate calligraphy"
*Effect:* Characterizes writer through age and handwriting.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Intransitive Arrival
"Barrabás came to us"—**intransitive verb** with dative. Syntax makes arrival active, deliberate.

### Prepositional Means
"by sea"—**instrumental preposition**. Syntax makes ocean the vehicle.

### Reporting Verb
"the child Clara wrote"—**definite article** with appositive and reporting verb. Syntax introduces narrator.

### Appositive Age
"the child Clara"—**noun-name** apposition. Syntax marks narrator's youth.

### Prepositional Manner
"in her delicate calligraphy"—**instrumental preposition** with possessive. Syntax makes handwriting visible.

### Adjectival Character
"delicate"—**adjective** describing writing. Syntax shows character through penmanship.

### Embedded Narration
Sentence exists as Clara's written words. Syntax creates layered narrative voice.

### Stylistic Effect
Through intransitive came-to-us arrival, instrumental by-sea means, definite child-Clara attribution, possessive delicate-calligraphy manner, and embedded narration structure, Allende creates syntax of magical chronicle—grammar that makes dog's arrival mythic through maritime journey while grounding fantastic in specific narrator's voice, characterized by youth and refined penmanship.
