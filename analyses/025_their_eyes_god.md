## Author and Source
**Zora Neale Hurston**, *Their Eyes Were Watching God* (1937), Chapter 1

## Passage

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Allegory** (AL-eh-gor-ee)
*Definition:* Extended metaphor in which elements symbolize abstract ideas.
*Example:* Ships representing dreams/hopes; the horizon representing unattainable goals.
*Effect:* Creates universal wisdom from concrete image; establishes philosophical tone.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nif-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Attribution of human qualities to non-human things.
*Example:* "Time" that mocks dreams; "ships" that have wishes aboard.
*Effect:* Makes abstract forces active agents; creates dramatic tension between human and fate.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition of ideas.
*Example:* "For some they come in...For others they sail forever"—fulfillment vs. perpetual longing.
*Effect:* Divides humanity into categories; creates tension between outcomes.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "For some...For others"; "never out of sight, never landing"
*Effect:* Creates rhythmic emphasis; structures the opposition between groups.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison between unlike things.
*Example:* Ships = dreams; horizon = unattainability; tide = fortune/opportunity
*Effect:* Transforms abstract philosophical concept into vivid maritime imagery.

### **Parallelism** (par-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structures in succession.
*Example:* "never out of sight, never landing"
*Effect:* Creates balance and emphasis through repetition of structure.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Deliberate exaggeration.
*Example:* "dreams mocked to death by Time"
*Effect:* Intensifies the tragedy of unfulfilled longing; makes rejection absolute.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Statement
"Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board"—this sentence uses **simple syntax** (subject-verb-object) but creates complex metaphor. The structure is:
- Subject: "Ships at a distance"
- Verb: "have"
- Object: "every man's wish on board"

The **prepositional phrase "at a distance"** is crucial—these aren't ships in harbor (attained) or ships that have sunk (lost), but ships "at a distance" (visible but not reached). The syntax creates liminal space through preposition.

The **possessive "every man's wish"** universalizes—not "some men's wishes" but EVERY man's. The syntax through quantifier creates universal human condition.

The phrase **"on board"** maintains the maritime metaphor literally (cargo on ship) while working metaphorically (wishes carried by dreams).

### Anaphoric Division
"For some they come in with the tide. For others they sail forever on the horizon"—these two sentences create **parallel structure through anaphora**:
- For some + [outcome]
- For others + [outcome]

This **syntactic parallelism** divides humanity into two categories, the fortunate and unfortunate. The form itself creates the division.

### First Group
"For some they come in with the tide"—this sentence uses:
- Prepositional phrase: "For some" (dative, indicating beneficiary)
- Subject: "they" (the ships/wishes)
- Phrasal verb: "come in"
- Prepositional phrase: "with the tide"

The **simple past "come in"** (or is this timeless present?) suggests fulfillment, arrival, realization. The syntax is **active**—the ships/wishes move.

The phrase **"with the tide"** suggests natural forces aiding. The syntax doesn't say "they struggle in" or "they are brought in" but "come in with the tide"—fortune assists them.

### Second Group
"For others they sail forever on the horizon"—this sentence parallels the previous but with crucial differences:
- Same opening: "For others"
- Same subject: "they"
- Different verb: "sail" (not "come in")
- Temporal modifier: "forever" (not just long, but eternally)
- Different location: "on the horizon" (not to shore)

The verb **"sail"** is intransitive and continuous—they keep sailing, never arriving. The syntax through verb choice creates perpetual motion without destination.

The adverb **"forever"** makes the condition eternal. The syntax through single word creates absolute hopelessness.

The phrase **"on the horizon"** is spatially precise—not "far away" (vague) or "at sea" (general) but specifically ON THE HORIZON—visible but unreachable, close enough to see, too far to touch.

### Accumulating Negatives
"never out of sight, never landing"—these **parallel negative phrases** use anaphora of "never" and similar structure:
- never + [prepositional phrase]: "out of sight"
- never + [present participle]: "landing"

The **double negatives** (both negative in meaning, not in grammatical form) emphasize what DOESN'T happen. The syntax accumulates what's absent, not present.

The phrase **"never out of sight"** is particularly cruel—the dreams remain visible, tormenting through proximity. The syntax makes clear this isn't absence but perpetual presence without fulfillment.

The **gerund "landing"** emphasizes the action that never occurs. The syntax focuses on the moment of achievement that never comes.

### Temporal Subordination
"until the Watcher turns his eyes away in resignation"—this **subordinate temporal clause** introduced by "until" specifies when the sailing ends. But wait—the previous phrase said "forever," suggesting no end. This creates **syntactic tension** between "forever" and "until."

The resolution: the sailing is forever UNLESS the watcher gives up. The syntax through temporal clause shows the only ending is surrender.

### Capitalized Abstraction
"the Watcher"—this is **capitalized mid-sentence**, making it allegorical. The syntax through capitalization transforms "a watcher" (specific person) into "the Watcher" (universal human type). This is similar to Medieval allegory (the Dreamer, the Pilgrim).

The **definite article "the"** suggests this is a known type, not a unique individual. The syntax creates archetype.

### Phrasal Verb
"turns his eyes away"—this **three-word phrasal verb** is more elaborate than "looks away." The syntax emphasizes the physical action of turning, the specific body part (eyes), the direction (away). This elaboration makes the giving-up seem more deliberate, more physical, more painful.

### Prepositional Phrase of Manner
"in resignation"—this **prepositional phrase** specifies how/why he turns away. The noun "resignation" is loaded—it means both:
- Acceptance of the inevitable
- Giving up of office/position

The syntax through word choice suggests both surrender and loss.

### Absolute Phrase
"his dreams mocked to death by Time"—this is an **absolute phrase** (also called nominative absolute), grammatically independent of the main clause but modifying it. The structure is:
- Noun phrase: "his dreams"
- Past participle: "mocked"
- Intensifier: "to death"
- Agent: "by Time"

This **absolute construction** is characteristic of formal, literary prose. It adds information while maintaining syntactic independence.

### Passive Voice
"mocked...by Time"—the **passive construction** emphasizes what happens to dreams (they are mocked) rather than who/what mocks them (though agent is specified). The syntax makes dreams the grammatical subject, emphasizing their victimhood.

### Intensifier
"to death"—this **prepositional phrase** functioning as intensifier makes the mocking absolute, fatal. The syntax doesn't just say "mocked" or even "cruelly mocked" but "mocked TO DEATH." The metaphor of death makes the disappointment ultimate, irreversible.

### Capitalized Time
"by Time"—the capitalization of **"Time"** (like "Watcher") makes it allegorical, a force, almost a deity. The syntax through typography treats Time as agent, actor, even antagonist.

The **passive agent "by Time"** is remarkable—Time isn't just context but active mocker. The syntax makes Time malevolent.

### Sentence Length Progression
Notice the **syntactic expansion**:
1. "Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board." (10 words)
2. "For some they come in with the tide." (8 words)
3. "For others they sail forever on the horizon, never out of sight, never landing until the Watcher turns his eyes away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time." (30 words)

The **dramatic expansion** of the third sentence mirrors its content—the interminable waiting, the accumulated suffering. The syntax through length enacts duration.

### Coordinate vs. Subordinate
The passage balances:
- **Coordinate**: "For some...For others"; "never out of sight, never landing"
- **Subordinate**: "until the Watcher turns..."; "his dreams mocked..."

This **syntactic variety** within parallel structures prevents monotony while maintaining formal balance.

### Maritime Semantic Field
The syntax maintains **consistent metaphoric vehicle** throughout:
- ships
- distance
- tide
- sail
- horizon
- out of sight
- landing

This **syntactic coherence** to the maritime metaphor creates unity. Every syntactic choice supports the central image.

### Universal to Particular
The syntax moves from **universal** ("every man's wish," "For some," "For others") to increasingly **particular** ("the Watcher," "his eyes," "his dreams"). This narrowing creates what Tufte calls **syntactic focusing**—moving from general human condition to individual experience.

### Implied Gender
Notice the syntax uses **masculine pronouns** exclusively: "every man's wish," "his eyes," "his dreams." The opening of the novel suggests this is the male experience. (The next paragraph will contrast with women's experience, using female pronouns.) The syntax through gendered pronouns creates the division that Hurston will explore.

### Rhythmic Quality
The passage has **almost Biblical or proverbial rhythm**:
"SHIPS at a DIS-tance HAVE ev-ery MAN's WISH on BOARD"

This rhythmic quality makes the prose memorable, quotable, almost mythic. The syntax achieves what Tufte calls "syntactic memorability through rhythm."

### Parataxis and Hypotaxis
The passage mixes:
- **Paratactic** (coordinate): The three short sentences could stand alone
- **Hypotactic** (subordinate): The final sentence has subordinate and absolute constructions

This syntactic variety creates rhythm—short, short, long; simple, simple, complex.

### Stylistic Effect
Through balanced antithesis, maritime allegory, and the shift from universal to particular, Hurston creates an opening that establishes both philosophical depth and narrative focus. The syntax performs wisdom literature—it sounds like proverb, like folk wisdom, like universal truth.

As Tufte emphasizes, this is **syntax as storytelling tradition**. Hurston, trained as anthropologist and folklorist, uses syntax that echoes oral wisdom traditions: the balanced oppositions, the concrete metaphor, the allegorical figures (the Watcher, Time), the rhythmic, memorable phrasing.

The syntax also performs a specifically African-American rhetorical tradition—the elaborated metaphor, the figurative language, the balance between individual and community, the acknowledgment of suffering without surrender to despair. The form honors the oral traditions Hurston documented while creating literary art.

The syntax's movement from ships to tide to horizon to Watcher to Time creates what Hurston called "the Negro farthest down"'s perspective—seeing life from position of those for whom ships often don't come in, for whom dreams often stay on the horizon. But the syntax doesn't make this tragic—it makes it universal, philosophical, even beautiful through the maritime imagery.

This is syntax that transforms suffering into wisdom, disappointment into philosophy, individual pain into collective understanding. Form and content achieve unity in prose that sounds both timeless and specifically rooted in African-American experience. The syntax IS the vision—balanced, beautiful, and unflinching in its recognition of both fortune and fate.
