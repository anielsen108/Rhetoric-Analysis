## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "I love thee" repeated throughout poem.
*Effect:* Creates incantatory accumulation of love's measurements.

### **Polysyndeton** (pah-lee-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Many conjunctions.
*Example:* "depth and breadth and height"
*Effect:* Slows pace; makes each dimension significant.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Love as spatial measurement (depth, breadth, height).
*Effect:* Makes abstract emotion geometrically quantifiable.

### **Synesthesia** (sin-es-THEE-zhuh)
*Definition:* Mixing sensory modes.
*Example:* Soul "reaching" and "feeling" for abstract concepts.
*Effect:* Makes spiritual quest physical.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Rhetorical Question Opening
"How do I love thee?"—**interrogative** immediately answered. Syntax creates dialogue with beloved.

### Imperative Self-Address
"Let me count the ways"—**imperative mood**. Syntax performs the enumeration it announces.

### Triple Measurement
"to the depth and breadth and height"—**three parallel nouns** with polysyndetic "and." Syntax creates three-dimensional space.

### Relative Clause Capacity
"My soul can reach"—**modal verb** expressing potential. Syntax makes love about spiritual capability.

### Temporal Clause
"when feeling out of sight"—**participial phrase** as temporal modifier. Syntax locates love in moments of transcendence.

### Prepositional Abstraction
"For the ends of being and ideal grace"—**two abstract noun phrases** as objects. Syntax aims love toward metaphysical goals.

### Stylistic Effect
Through rhetorical question, polysyndetic enumeration, modal capacity, and abstract prepositional objects, Browning creates syntax of measured transcendence—grammar that quantifies the infinite.
