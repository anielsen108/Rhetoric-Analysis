## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to non-human.
*Example:* "the earth and the air seemed to tremble"
*Effect:* Makes natural world participate in human excitement.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* "frenzy of gladness"; earth and air trembling.
*Effect:* Amplifies crowd's excitement to cosmic scale.

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh)
*Definition:* Single verb governing different objects.
*Example:* Earth and air both "tremble" (though differently affected).
*Effect:* Unifies disparate elements in shared response.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Intransitive Action
"The trumpets sounded"—**simple subject-verb**. Syntax creates abrupt, dramatic start.

### Coordinating Consequence
"and instantly"—**conjunction with temporal adverb**. Syntax shows immediate effect.

### Passive Clearing
"the arena was cleared"—**passive construction**. Syntax emphasizes result over agent.

### Prepositional Purpose
"for the race"—**purpose phrase**. Syntax establishes goal of clearing.

### Simple Past Reaction
"The people shouted"—**collective subject with active verb**. Syntax treats crowd as singular entity.

### Genitive Emotion
"in a frenzy of gladness"—**nested prepositional phrases** with abstract nouns. Syntax qualifies emotion as extreme.

### Compound Subject
"the earth and the air"—**two subjects** representing totality. Syntax makes response universal.

### Verb of Seeming
"seemed to tremble"—**linking verb with infinitive**. Syntax qualifies observation as impression.

### Prepositional Cause
"with the transport"—**prepositional phrase** showing cause. Syntax attributes trembling to ecstasy.

### Stylistic Effect
Through abrupt trumpet signal, passive instantaneous clearing, collective singular subject, genitive of frenzied emotion, compound earth/air subject seeming to tremble, Wallace creates syntax of epic spectacle—grammar that amplifies chariot race to cosmic event through personification and hyperbolic participation of nature.
