## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Night as adversity; pit as despair; soul as fortress.
*Effect:* Makes abstract suffering concrete and spatial.

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* "Black as the pit from pole to pole"
*Effect:* Emphasizes totality of darkness through geographic scope.

### **Litotes** (LIE-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "unconquerable" (cannot be conquered).
*Effect:* Emphasizes invincibility through negative construction.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Prepositional Opening
"Out of the night that covers me"—begins with **prepositional phrase** positioning speaker as emerging FROM darkness, not merely in it.

### Comparative Structure
"Black as the pit from pole to pole"—**simile** using "as...as" with geographic scope (pole to pole) making personal darkness cosmic.

### Agnostic Thanksgiving
"I thank whatever gods may be"—**compound relative pronoun** + **modal "may be"** creates philosophical uncertainty. Syntax makes this agnostic gratitude.

### Triple Negation
"unconquerable"—morphology of **un- + conquer + -able** creates triple assertion: not able to be conquered = absolutely invincible.

### Stylistic Effect
Through metaphoric geography, agnostic thanksgiving, and multiply-negated assertion, Henley creates Victorian stoicism. Form IS defiance—syntax emerging OUT OF darkness to assert unconquerable self.
