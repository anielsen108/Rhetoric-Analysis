# Passage 163: "The Stranger"

## Author and Source
**Albert Camus**, *The Stranger* (1942, trans. from French)

## Passage
> Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know. I got a telegram from the home: "Mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow. Faithfully yours." That doesn't mean anything. Maybe it was yesterday.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement.
*Example:* "I don't know" about mother's death date.
*Effect:* Shocks with emotional disconnection.

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to surface.
*Example:* "Faithfully yours" in death telegram.
*Effect:* Exposes institutional language's meaninglessness.

### **Aposiopesis** (ap-oh-sy-oh-PEE-sis)
*Definition:* Trailing off.
*Example:* "Maybe it was yesterday" after dismissing telegram.
*Effect:* Shows circular, uncertain thought process.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Simple Past Declaration
"Maman died today"—**subject-verb-temporal adverb**. Syntax makes announcement with false certainty.

### Disjunctive Alternative
"Or yesterday maybe"—**coordinating conjunction** with uncertainty adverb. Syntax immediately undermines opening.

### Epistemic Negation
"I don't know"—**negated cognitive verb**. Syntax admits profound ignorance about crucial fact.

### Verb of Receipt
"I got a telegram"—**simple past**. Syntax treats notification as mere reception.

### Telegraphic Style
"Mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow."—**abbreviated sentences** without articles. Syntax performs telegram's compressed form.

### Formulaic Closing
"Faithfully yours"—**quoted institutional phrase**. Syntax highlights absurd formality.

### Dismissive Judgment
"That doesn't mean anything"—**negative existential**. Syntax nullifies telegram's content.

### Tentative Repetition
"Maybe it was yesterday"—**modal adverb** with past tense. Syntax circles back to unresolved uncertainty.

### Stylistic Effect
Through simple past false certainty, immediate disjunctive maybe, epistemic I-don't-know, telegraphic abbreviated institutional language, dismissive that-means-nothing, and circular maybe-yesterday return, Camus creates syntax of absurdist alienation—grammar showing Meursault's radical disconnection where even mother's death cannot generate clear knowledge or appropriate feeling.
