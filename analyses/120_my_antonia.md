## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to surface.
*Example:* "Confident, unenquiring belief" in refinement.
*Effect:* Exposes town girls' unexamined class prejudice.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "worked out" for domestic servitude.
*Effect:* Shows how language masks exploitation.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* Town merchants' daughters vs. country girls who work.
*Effect:* Creates class division through syntactic opposition.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Compound Adjective Modification
"confident, unenquiring belief"—**two adjectives** before noun. Syntax pairs confidence with intellectual laziness.

### Scare Quotes
"refined" and "worked out" in quotation marks. Syntax signals narrator's ironic distance from these terms.

### Copulative Class Assertion
"they were 'refined'"—**copula** with quoted adjective. Syntax shows belief in essential identity.

### Relative Clause Definition
"who 'worked out'"—**restrictive relative clause** defines country girls by labor. Syntax makes work their defining characteristic.

### Negative Copula
"were not"—**negative predicate**. Syntax completes binary opposition: refined/not refined.

### Parallel Structure
"they were...were not"—**parallel copulative constructions**. Syntax creates symmetrical class division.

### Genitive Specificity
"daughters of Black Hawk merchants"—**genitive construction**. Syntax identifies town girls through fathers' occupations.

### Stylistic Effect
Through compound adjectives pairing confidence with lack of inquiry, scare quotes signaling irony, copulative class assertions, and parallel positive/negative constructions, Cather creates syntax of class prejudice—grammar that exposes how unexamined belief in refinement masks economic exploitation.
