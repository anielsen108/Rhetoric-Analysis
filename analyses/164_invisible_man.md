# Passage 164: "Invisible Man"

## Author and Source
**Ralph Ellison**, *Invisible Man* (1952)

## Passage
> I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids—and I might even be said to possess a mind.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "I am...No, I am not...nor am I...I am"
*Effect:* Builds identity through negation and assertion.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "I might even be said to possess a mind"
*Effect:* Ironically understates intelligence in face of society's denial.

### **Polysyndeton** (pah-lee-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Many conjunctions.
*Example:* "flesh and bone, fiber and liquids"
*Effect:* Accumulates proof of physical existence.

### **Allusion** (uh-LOO-zhun)
*Definition:* Reference to other work.
*Example:* Edgar Allan Poe's ghosts; Hollywood ectoplasms.
*Effect:* Distinguishes racial invisibility from supernatural.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Copulative Self-Definition
"I am an invisible man"—**subject-copula-complement**. Syntax makes paradoxical claim about existence.

### Oxymoronic Phrase
"invisible man"—**contradictory adjective-noun**. Syntax performs paradox of social erasure.

### Adversative Negation
"No, I am not a spook"—**interjection** with negative copula. Syntax rejects misinterpretation.

### Comparative Relative
"like those who haunted"—**simile with relative clause**. Syntax specifies rejected comparison.

### Correlative Negation
"nor am I one of your"—**negative correlative**. Syntax continues rejection series.

### Possessive Address
"your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms"—**possessive pronoun** implicating reader. Syntax assigns ownership of stereotype.

### Material Specification
"of substance, of flesh and bone"—**series of genitives**. Syntax insists on physical reality.

### Coordinate Materiality
"fiber and liquids"—**paired nouns**. Syntax reduces body to components proving existence.

### Modal Passive Irony
"might even be said to possess a mind"—**modal passive** with infinitive. Syntax mockingly suggests thinking might be granted to him.

### Stylistic Effect
Through copulative oxymoronic invisible-man, adversative no-not-spook negations, comparative Poe/Hollywood rejections, possessive your-ectoplasms implicating reader, genitive material flesh-bone-fiber-liquids accumulation, and modal passive even-possessing-mind irony, Ellison creates syntax of paradoxical assertion—grammar that insists on physical existence while acknowledging social erasure, culminating in bitter understatement about mental capacity.
