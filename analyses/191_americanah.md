# Passage 191: "Americanah"

## Author and Source
**Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie**, *Americanah* (2013)

## Passage
> Princeton, in the summer, smelled of nothing, and although Ifemelu liked the tranquil greenness of the many trees, the clean streets and stately homes, the delicately overpriced shops, and the quiet, abiding air of earned grace, it was this, the lack of a smell, that most appealed to her.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Seeming contradiction.
*Example:* Liking many things but most liking "lack of smell"
*Effect:* Shows immigrant's relationship to privilege as defined by absence.

### **Oxymoron** (ahk-see-MOR-ahn)
*Definition:* Contradictory terms.
*Example:* "delicately overpriced"
*Effect:* Mocks pretension of expensive boutiques.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "the tranquil...the clean...the delicately...the quiet"
*Effect:* Accumulates observations of privileged space.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Geographical Subject
"Princeton, in the summer"—**proper name** with temporal appositive. Syntax anchors observation to place and season.

### Intransitive Smell
"smelled of nothing"—**sensory verb** with negative object. Syntax makes absence into presence.

### Concessive Conjunction
"and although Ifemelu liked"—**subordinating concession**. Syntax introduces what she appreciates.

### Accumulating Objects
"the tranquil greenness...the clean streets...the delicately overpriced shops...the quiet...air"—**series of definite noun phrases**. Syntax catalogs elite space.

### Adjectival Paradox
"delicately overpriced"—**manner adverb** modifying economic adjective. Syntax mocks boutique pretension.

### Participial Grace
"abiding air of earned grace"—**present participle** with abstract genitive. Syntax captures Princeton's self-satisfaction.

### Demonstrative Pivot
"it was this"—**copula** with deictic subject. Syntax performs revelation.

### Appositive Specification
"the lack of a smell"—**definite article** making absence concrete. Syntax names what was revealed.

### Relative Superlative
"that most appealed to her"—**restrictive relative** with superlative. Syntax makes absence most attractive quality.

### Stylistic Effect
Through geographical Princeton-in-summer subject, intransitive smelled-of-nothing absence, concessive although-liked accumulation of definite tranquil-greenness/clean-streets/delicately-overpriced-shops/quiet-earned-grace, demonstrative it-was-this pivot, appositive lack-of-smell specification, and relative most-appealed superlative, Adichie creates syntax of immigrant privilege-perception—grammar that accumulates elite space's qualities but makes odorlessness the most appealing, suggesting escape from sensory intensity of home.
