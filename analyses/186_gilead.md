# Passage 186: "Gilead"

## Author and Source
**Marilynne Robinson**, *Gilead* (2004)

## Passage
> I told you last night that I might be gone sometime, and you said, Where, and I said, To be with the Good Lord, and you said, Why, and I said, Because I'm old, and you said, I don't think you're old.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "and you said...and I said...and you said...and you said"
*Effect:* Creates rhythm of remembered dialogue.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "To be with the Good Lord" for death.
*Effect:* Uses religious language to soften mortality for child.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* Child's "I don't think you're old"
*Effect:* Shows child's innocent negation of father's age.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Past Reporting
"I told you last night"—**simple past** with temporal adverb. Syntax establishes conversational memory.

### Subordinate Clause
"that I might be gone sometime"—**modal subordination** with vague temporal. Syntax shows tentative death announcement.

### Polysyndetic Dialogue
"and you said...and I said"—**multiple coordinating conjunctions**. Syntax creates back-and-forth rhythm.

### Interrogative Responses
"Where...Why"—**single-word questions**. Syntax shows child's concrete, simple queries.

### Prepositional Destination
"To be with the Good Lord"—**purpose infinitive** with capitalized religious phrase. Syntax makes death into reunion.

### Causal Because
"Because I'm old"—**causal conjunction** with copula. Syntax gives simple explanation.

### Negative Think
"I don't think you're old"—**negated cognitive verb** with copula. Syntax shows child's rejection through thought-verb.

### Dialogue Without Tags
Most exchanges lack "he said" after first. Syntax strips conversation to essential voices.

### Stylistic Effect
Through polysyndetic and-you-said/and-I-said rhythm, modal might-be-gone tentative announcement, interrogative where/why child-questions, euphemistic Good-Lord destination, causal because-I'm-old explanation, negative don't-think-you're-old rejection, and tag-stripped dialogue, Robinson creates syntax of intergenerational conversation—grammar that performs dying father's gentle death-talk with son through rhythmic exchange, religious euphemism meeting child's concrete questions and loving negation.
