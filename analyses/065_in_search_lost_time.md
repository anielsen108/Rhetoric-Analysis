# Passage 065: Madeleine Epiphany (*In Search of Lost Time*)

**Marcel Proust** · *Du côté de chez Swann* (*Swann's Way*) · 1913 | "Combray" section (C.K. Scott Moncrieff translation)

**Occasion/Pressure:** Narrator tastes the madeleine dipped in tea, triggering involuntary memory; sentence must dramatize revelation and unfold childhood ritual.
**Persona/Stance:** First-person narrator describing his own perception with philosophical precision.
**Thesis of Effect:** Conjunction-led entrance, reflexive verbs, and cascading relative clauses make memory feel like an autonomous being revealing nested worlds.

## PASSAGE

[L1] And suddenly the memory revealed itself.
[L2] The taste was that of the little piece of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray my aunt Léonie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of tea or tisane.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun / ˌpɜːrsənɪfɪˈkeɪʃən)
**Lines:** L1
**Evidence:** Memory "revealed itself."
**Effect:** Memory acts, narrator receives; involuntary recall dramatized.

### **Epiphany Structure**
**Lines:** L1–L2
**Definition:** Sudden insight captured in narration.
**Effect:** Creates pivot from bewilderment to clarity.

### **Apposition/Periphrasis**
**Lines:** L2
**Evidence:** "The taste was that of the little piece of madeleine."
**Effect:** Elaborate naming delays identification, mirroring slow emergence.

### **Imagistic Metonymy**
**Lines:** L2
**Evidence:** Madeleines stand for entire Combray childhood.
**Effect:** Concrete object unlocks vast memory.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Parataxis leading to Hypotaxis**
**Lines:** L1–L2
**Evidence:** Short independent clause followed by heavily subordinated sentence.
**Effect:** Shock of revelation → luxuriant unpacking.

### **Relative Clause Cascade**
**Lines:** L2
**Evidence:** "which…used to give me" with participial "dipping…"
**Effect:** Memory expands via grammatical embedding.

### **Temporal/Spatial Fronting**
**Lines:** L2
**Evidence:** "on Sunday mornings at Combray" preceding verb.
**Effect:** Scene-setting before action, evoking ritual.

### **Participial Tail**
**Lines:** L2
**Evidence:** "dipping it first…"
**Effect:** Adds sensory motion, replicating aunt's gesture.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Anaphoric Continuation**
**Signals:** Sentence begins with "And," linking to prior meditation.
**Effect:** Revelation feels like continuation, not rupture.

### **Reflexive Agency**
**Signals:** "revealed itself."
**Effect:** Emphasizes passivity of perceiver; memory emerges autonomously.

### **Aspectual Habit**
**Signals:** "used to give me."
**Effect:** Highlights iterative past; memory rooted in repeated ritual.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Soft liquids (l) and nasals (m, n) evoke languid savoring; sudden plosive in "suddenly" marks jolt.

**Cadence seams:** Period after L1 isolates epiphany; L2 flows with commas mimicking ripples.

**Alliteration:** "madeleine" / "mornings" / "my" create murmuring hum of domesticity.

**Music argues:** Quick flare then long legato sentence replicates flavor spreading.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Independent clause (L1) + extended loose sentence (L2) with multiple embeddings.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** "The taste" fronted before identification.
- **Mid:** Relative clause introduces context before verb.
- **Postposed:** Participial phrase extends after noun clause.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Heavy subordination; only minimal coordination within participle.

**Information flow:** Revelation → sensory identification → spatial/temporal setting → habitual giver → ritual act.

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"Suddenly memory returned: it was the madeleine my aunt dipped in tea on Sundays."* — Clear but loses hypnotic delay.
- **Dilated:** *"And in an instant memory disclosed itself; the flavour proved to be that of the small madeleine my Aunt Léonie would place in my mouth each Sunday morning at Combray, after first dipping it into her cup of tea or soothing tisane."* — Maintains detail but heavier diction.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Narrator in present; references "at Combray" anchor past location.

**Aspect:** Present perfect implicit (revealed) vs. habitual past (used to give).

**Modality:** None; assertions absolute.

**Temporal logic:** Present sensation triggers childhood routine; grammar bridges times.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Illumination:** Memory reveals itself.
2. **Taste/ritual:** Tea, madeleine, Sunday mornings.

**Lexical fields:** Sensory perception, domestic ritual, family.

**Image logic:** Warm ritual emerges like light, triggered by taste.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** First-person introspection.

**Time:** Present tasting unlocking past; double temporal layer.

**Beat structure:** Sudden recognition → detailed recollection of ritual.

**Subtext:** Memory tied to maternal/guardian love; art of remembrance arises from domestic comfort.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Narrator demonstrates keen introspective skill.

**Pathos:** Nostalgia for aunt's care; small domestic gesture carries emotional weight.

**Logos:** Sentence models associative logic: taste → object → giver → routine.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Symbolist prose:** Musical, sensuous syntax akin to Baudelaire.

**Philosophy of memory:** Anticipates Bergson’s durée; narrative becomes phenomenology.

**Modernist interiority:** Influences Woolf, Joyce in stream-of-conscious recall.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"And suddenly"** — epiphany trigger.
2. **"little piece of madeleine"** — concrete anchor.
3. **"dipping it first"** — tactile ritual.

### Faultlines
1. **Translation choices:** "tea or tisane" nuance; other versions specify lime-blossom tea.
2. **Potential preciousness:** Elaborate phrasing risks sentimentality; redeemed by exact detail.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove "little"—loses intimacy and precise sensory scale.

**Amplification test:** Add "fragrant" before tea—heightens sensory detail but might over-embellish.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"And forthwith the memory manifested itself…"*
- **Colloquial:** *"And suddenly I remembered: it tasted like the madeleine Aunt Léonie dipped in her tea on Sundays."*

**Punctuation swap:** Replace comma before "dipping" with semicolon; would stiffen flow, reduce dissolving quality.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *And at once the memory surfaced. The flavour belonged to the little square of shortbread my mother used to press into her tea before handing it to me.*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *I suddenly remembered the madeleine my aunt gave me on Sundays.* — Flat, missing layered ritual.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *Suddenly the memory appeared: the taste of the small madeleine Aunt Léonie dipped in her tea for me on Combray Sundays.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Use "And suddenly" to catapult readers into revelation mid-stream.
2. Personify memory so recollection feels autonomous.
3. Delay naming object through periphrasis to mimic unfolding awareness.
4. Front-load temporal/spatial details to place reader inside ritual.
5. Attach participial gestures to sensory nouns for tactile immediacy.
6. Juxtapose brief epiphany sentence with long descriptive sentence to balance shock and savor.
7. Let concrete objects stand in for entire emotional worlds.
