## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Revelation Structure** (rev-uh-LAY-shun STRUK-chur)
*Definition:* Syntax of sudden discovery.
*Example:* "And suddenly the memory revealed itself"
*Effect:* Creates dramatic moment of recognition; makes memory active agent.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nif-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Attribution of human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Memory "reveals itself"—memory acts.
*Effect:* Makes memory autonomous, not controlled by rememberer.

###  **Apposition** (ap-uh-ZIH-shun)
*Definition:* Explanatory renaming.
*Example:* "The taste was that of the little piece of madeleine which..."
*Effect:* Creates elaborate unfolding of memory's content.

### **Relative Clause Extension** (REL-uh-tiv klawz eks-TEN-shun)
*Definition:* Subordinate clauses extending description.
*Example:* "which...my aunt...used to give me, dipping it..."
*Effect:* Creates characteristic Proustian accumulation of nested detail.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Dramatic Opening
"And suddenly the memory revealed itself"—the **coordinating conjunction "And"** continuing previous sentence creates continuity. The **adverb "suddenly"** marks the crucial moment.

The **reflexive verb "revealed itself"** makes memory the agent. Not "I remembered" but "memory revealed itself"—the syntax through voice choice makes this involuntary, autonomous.

### Copulative Identification
"The taste was that of"—the **demonstrative pronoun "that"** + **prepositional phrase "of"** creates elaborate periphrasis. Direct statement would be "The taste was the madeleine's." Proust's syntax delays, elaborates.

### Accumulated Modification
"the little piece of madeleine"—the **article + adjective + noun + prepositional phrase** creates specific,  detailed identification. Not just "madeleine" but "little piece of madeleine"—the syntax through modification creates precision and intimacy.

### Relative Clause
"which on Sunday mornings at Combray"—the **restrictive relative clause** begins with temporal and spatial specifications before reaching the verb. The syntax delays action through circumstantial detail.

### Possessive Construction
"my aunt Léonie"—the **possessive + appositive proper noun** creates intimate family specificity. The syntax makes this personal, not general.

### Habitual Past
"used to give me"—the **construction "used to"** indicates habitual past action. The syntax emphasizes repetition, ritual, custom—this happened regularly, creating pattern.

### Present Participle
"dipping it first in her own cup"—the **participial phrase** adds simultaneous action. The **adverb "first"** indicates sequence; the **possessive "her own"** creates further specificity.

### Nested Detail
The sentence contains **multiple levels of embedding**:
- Main clause: memory revealed itself
- - The taste was...
- - - of the madeleine
- - - - which...aunt...used to give
- - - - - dipping it...

This **syntactic nesting** creates Proust's characteristic style—detail within detail, memory within memory.

### Stylistic Effect
Through reflexive verbs making memory autonomous, elaborate relative clauses, and nested modifications, Proust creates syntax of involuntary memory. The form performs the content: syntax that unfolds slowly, accumulates detail, delays resolution just as memory itself unfolds. Grammar as remembering—syntax that enacts the gradual revelation of what was forgotten.
