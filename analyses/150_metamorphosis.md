## Author and Source

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement.
*Example:* "uneasy dreams" for nightmarish transformation.
*Effect:* Understates cosmic horror with mild adjective.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* "gigantic insect"
*Effect:* Amplifies impossible transformation.

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Contrast between expectation and reality.
*Example:* Mundane "one morning" for catastrophic change.
*Effect:* Makes supernatural event seem routine.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Temporal Subordinate Clause
"As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning"—**temporal conjunction** with proper name. Syntax grounds fantastical in ordinary waking.

### Prepositional Source
"from uneasy dreams"—**ablative preposition** showing origin. Syntax suggests transformation may be dream's continuation.

### Object-Complement Discovery
"found himself transformed"—**transitive verb** with reflexive object and past participle. Syntax makes discovery passive, already completed.

### Locative Specification
"in his bed"—**prepositional phrase** of familiar location. Syntax anchors horror in domestic space.

### Prepositional Result
"into a gigantic insect"—**transformation preposition**. Syntax performs categorical change through grammar.

### Indefinite Article
"a gigantic insect"—**indefinite article**. Syntax makes him one of a class, not unique monster.

### Adjectival Amplification
"gigantic"—**size adjective**. Syntax emphasizes scale of impossible transformation.

### Stylistic Effect
Through temporal ordinary awakening, understated dream-origin, completed passive transformation discovered, domestic bed location, and indefinite gigantic insect result, Kafka creates syntax of absurdist acceptance—grammar that presents impossible metamorphosis with the matter-of-fact structure of waking to find oneself late for work.
