## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Invocation** (in-voh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Direct appeal to a muse or deity for inspiration.
*Example:* "Sing, Heavenly Muse"
*Effect:* Places the poem in the epic tradition; claims divine authority for the narrative.

### **Anastrophe** (uh-NAS-truh-fee)
*Definition:* Inversion of normal word order.
*Example:* "Of Man's first disobedience" (instead of normal order).
*Effect:* Creates elevated, formal tone; emphasizes "disobedience" by placing it last.

### **Periodic Sentence** (peer-ee-AH-dik SEN-tense)
*Definition:* Sentence whose main clause comes at the end.
*Example:* The entire passage suspends meaning until "Sing."
*Effect:* Builds anticipation; mirrors the epic's grand scope; demonstrates control.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Substitution of an attribute for the thing meant.
*Example:* "the fruit" for the apple; "Eden" for paradise; "seat" for throne.
*Effect:* Condenses complex theological concepts into concrete images.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-EK-duh-kee)
*Definition:* Part represents the whole.
*Example:* "Man" represents all humanity; "the fruit" represents the entire act of disobedience.
*Effect:* Universalizes the story; makes one moment represent all of human history.

### **Hyperbaton** (hy-PER-buh-ton)
*Definition:* Separation of words that naturally belong together.
*Example:* "till one greater Man / Restore us" (split across lines).
*Effect:* Creates suspense; emphasizes both parts of the split phrase.

### **Polyptoton** (pol-ip-TOH-ton)
*Definition:* Repetition of words derived from the same root.
*Example:* "loss" and "Restore," "seat" and "regain" (concepts of losing and regaining).
*Effect:* Emphasizes the pattern of fall and redemption central to the poem.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### The Extended Periodic Structure
This is one of the most famous examples of **periodic syntax** in English literature. The sentence extends for multiple lines, with the subject and verb ("Sing, Heavenly Muse") withheld until after all the prepositional phrases. The syntax demands patience and attention—we cannot understand the grammatical structure until we reach the imperative verb.

### Opening with Preposition
"Of Man's first disobedience"—beginning with a **preposition** is unusual and formal. The object comes before we know what action it relates to. This **syntactic inversion** (of natural English word order, which would be subject-verb-object) signals that this is elevated, poetic discourse operating under different grammatical rules.

### Genitive Construction
"Man's first disobedience"—the **possessive/genitive case** links humanity to sin. Syntactically, "first" modifies "disobedience," but conceptually it's about temporal priority—this is where it all began. The syntax makes disobedience belong to humanity.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
"and the fruit / Of that forbidden tree"—the **coordinating conjunction "and"** suggests we're listing parallel things, but "the fruit" is actually part of "first disobedience," not separate from it. The syntax creates ambiguity: are these two things or one thing described two ways?

### Nested Relative Clauses
"whose mortal taste / Brought death"—the **relative clause** modifies "tree" (technically) but really describes the fruit and the act of eating. The syntax nests description within description:
- Of disobedience
  - and the fruit
    - of that forbidden tree
      - whose mortal taste
        - brought death

This **embedded structure** mirrors the theological concept of how one act contains cascading consequences.

### Parallel Consequences
"Brought death into the World, and all our woe, / With loss of Eden"—the syntax accumulates the consequences:
1. death into the World
2. all our woe
3. loss of Eden

These are linked by **polysyndeton** ("and") and **prepositional parallelism** ("into the World," "With loss of Eden"). The syntax makes each consequence feel like another weight added to the scale.

### Temporal Subordination
"till one greater Man / Restore us"—the **temporal conjunction "till"** introduces a **subordinate clause** that extends into the future. This is grammatically complex: "till" usually requires a past tense verb ("until he restored us") but Milton uses the bare infinitive ("Restore"), creating a sense of timeless certainty.

The **enjambment** between "Man" and "Restore" across the line break creates suspense—we don't know what this "greater Man" will do until the next line.

### Parallel Infinitives
"Restore us, and regain the blissful seat"—two **infinitives** in parallel construction:
- Restore + object (us)
- regain + object (the blissful seat)

The syntax is **coordinate**, suggesting these are parallel actions, but they're really the same action viewed from different perspectives (restore humanity vs. regain paradise).

### The Delayed Imperative
"Sing, Heavenly Muse"—finally, after all the prepositional phrases and subordinate clauses, we get the **main verb: an imperative**. The syntax has been building all this time to a command. This inverted structure (placing the command after all the content) gives the command tremendous force—we've been waiting for the sentence to resolve grammatically.

### Vocative Placement
"Heavenly Muse" is in the **vocative case** (direct address), placed after the verb rather than before. This creates the pattern: [verb] [addressee], rather than the more common [addressee], [verb]. This inversion emphasizes both the verb ("Sing") and the invoked figure ("Heavenly Muse").

### Syntactic Elevation
Everything about this syntax signals **elevated discourse**:
- Inverted word order (prepositions before verbs)
- Delayed main clause (periodic structure)
- Complex embedding (nested subordinate clauses)
- Archaic constructions (bare infinitive after "till")
- Minimal articles (just "the," none where modern English would use them)

This is syntax that announces: this is Epic, operating under special grammatical rules.

### Enjambment Strategy
Milton uses **enjambment** (running sentences across line breaks) strategically:
- "fruit / Of that"—forces pause on "fruit"
- "taste / Brought death"—suspends before the consequence
- "greater Man / Restore us"—delays the redemptive action

Each line break creates a mini-suspension, making the syntax enact the poem's theme of delay, fall, and eventual redemption.

### Modification Patterns
Notice the **key modifiers**:
- "first" (temporal)
- "forbidden" (moral/legal)
- "mortal" (deadly)
- "greater" (comparative superiority)
- "blissful" (emotional quality)

Each modifier is carefully placed for maximum emphasis, often in **attributive position** before the noun, creating a formal, elevated tone.

### Syntax as Authority
The sheer control of this extended periodic sentence demonstrates **syntactic mastery**. Milton shows he can sustain a grammatical structure through multiple lines and still resolve it perfectly. This syntactic skill claims authority—a poet with this much control over language can be trusted with this enormous subject.

### Stylistic Effect
Through elaborate periodic structure, syntactic inversion, and strategic suspension, Milton creates prose that embodies **epic grandeur**. The syntax doesn't just describe the fall of man—it enacts the fall through its downward movement from disobedience through consequences, and then enacts redemption through its delayed resolution. This is syntax as theology: the form contains the entire pattern of fall and redemption within its grammatical structure. As Tufte emphasizes, syntax here isn't ornamentation—it IS the meaning. The prolonged suspension before resolution mirrors humanity's prolonged wait for salvation. Form and content achieve perfect unity.
