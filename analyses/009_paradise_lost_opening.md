# Passage 009: Paradise Lost Opening

**John Milton** · *Paradise Lost* · 1667 | Book I, Lines 1–6

**Occasion/Pressure:** Epic poem's threshold; poet must invoke divine authority while announcing subject (fall of man) in register worthy of Scripture.
**Persona/Stance:** Vatic poet claiming prophetic voice; subordinates himself to Heavenly Muse while asserting unprecedented ambition.
**Thesis of Effect:** Syntax suspends meaning through radical periodic structure until imperative command ("Sing") arrives—form enacts the fall's downward trajectory and redemption's delayed arrival.

---

## PASSAGE

[L1] Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit
[L2] Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
[L3] Brought death into the World, and all our woe,
[L4] With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
[L5] Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,
[L6] Sing, Heavenly Muse...

---

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Invocation** (in-voh-KAY-shun / ˌɪnvoʊˈkeɪʃən)
**Lines:** L6
**Definition:** Direct appeal to deity or muse for inspiration.
**Evidence:** "Sing, Heavenly Muse"—command addressed to divine source.
**Effect:** Places poem in epic tradition (Homer, Virgil); claims authority beyond poet's personal capacity. Reader accepts supernatural sanction for narrative audacity.
**Near-miss:** Not prayer (petition for aid): invocation *commands* the muse, asserting poet's right to divine voice.

### **Anastrophe** (uh-NAS-truh-fee / əˈnæstrəfi)
**Lines:** L1–5
**Definition:** Inversion of natural word order.
**Evidence:** "Of Man's first disobedience" opens—preposition before subject/verb; normal order would be "Sing of Man's first disobedience."
**Effect:** Elevated formality; foregrounds content before action. Reader suspended in prepositional preamble, enacting the long wait from fall to redemption.
**Near-miss:** Not hyperbaton (mere separation): anastrophe inverts *entire* sentence structure, placing dependent material first.

### **Periodic Sentence** (PEER-ee-AH-dic / ˌpɪriˈɒdɪk)
**Lines:** L1–6
**Definition:** Main clause withheld until sentence end.
**Evidence:** Subject ("Muse") and verb ("Sing") delayed through five lines of prepositional/subordinate material.
**Effect:** Grammatical suspense mirrors theological suspense (fall → redemption). Reader cannot parse meaning until final resolution; the wait *is* the form.
**Near-miss:** Not loose/cumulative (which resolves early then adds): periodic *suspends*, holding meaning hostage.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee / məˈtɒnɪmi)
**Lines:** L1 ("fruit"), L4 ("Eden"), L5 ("seat")
**Definition:** Substitution of attribute for thing meant.
**Evidence:** "the fruit" = act of disobedience; "Eden" = paradise state; "seat" = throne of heaven.
**Effect:** Condenses theological complexity into concrete images. Reader grasps vast concepts through tangible objects—fruit carries weight of original sin.
**Near-miss:** Not symbol (arbitrary sign): metonymy works through *contiguity*—fruit was *at* the Fall, not just representing it.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-EK-duh-kee / sɪˈnɛkdəki)
**Lines:** L1 ("Man"), L4 ("one greater Man")
**Definition:** Part represents whole, or species for individual.
**Evidence:** "Man" = all humanity; "one greater Man" = Christ representing divine redemption.
**Effect:** Universalizes narrative—Adam's fall is every person's fall; Christ's restoration is universal. Reader sees herself in "Man."
**Near-miss:** Not metonymy (attribute for thing): synecdoche uses *part-whole* relationship—individual Adam stands for species.

### **Polyptoton** (pol-ip-TOH-ton / ˌpɒlɪpˈtoʊtɒn)
**Lines:** L4–5
**Definition:** Repetition of words from same root in different forms.
**Evidence:** "loss" / "Restore" / "regain"—lose/restore/gain variations.
**Effect:** Emphasizes fall-redemption pattern through morphological echo. Reader hears the theological cycle in the word-roots themselves.
**Near-miss:** Not simple repetition: polyptoton varies the *form* while keeping root, creating family resemblance.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Enjambment** (en-JAM-ment / ɛnˈdʒæmmənt)
**Lines:** L1/2, L2/3, L3/4, L4/5, L5/6
**Definition:** Sentence continuation across line breaks without pause.
**Evidence:** "fruit / Of that forbidden tree"; "taste / Brought death"; "greater Man / Restore us."
**Effect:** Syntax refuses metrical containment—meaning spills over, enacting overflow of consequences. Reader must continue to next line for grammatical completion; form mirrors fall's cascading effects.
**Risk:** Can feel arbitrary if breaks aren't strategic. Milton places breaks before key revelations ("Brought death," "Restore us"), creating suspense.

### **Polysyndeton** (pol-ee-SIN-duh-ton / ˌpɒliˈsɪndɪtɒn)
**Lines:** L1, L3, L5
**Definition:** Multiple conjunctions in close succession.
**Evidence:** "disobedience, and the fruit...and all our woe...Restore us, and regain..."
**Effect:** Accumulation without hierarchy; each element given equal grammatical weight. Reader experiences the piling-up of consequences and redemptive acts.
**Risk:** Can feel tedious. Here, "and" links monumental events, making each addition feel additive, not redundant.

### **Hyperbaton** (hy-PER-buh-ton / haɪˈpɜːrbətɒn)
**Lines:** L1–2, L4–5
**Definition:** Separation of words naturally belonging together.
**Evidence:** "the fruit / Of that forbidden tree" (fruit separated from its modifier); "till one greater Man / Restore us" (subject split from verb across line).
**Effect:** Syntactic delay creates emphasis on both separated parts. Reader pauses on "fruit" before learning which tree; "Man" hangs before his redemptive action.
**Risk:** Can feel mannered. Milton uses line breaks to naturalize the separation.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh / əˈnæfərə)
**Lines:** L1, L2 ("Of...Of")
**Definition:** Repetition of words at clause beginnings.
**Evidence:** "Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit / Of that forbidden tree..."
**Effect:** Hammering insistence; each "Of" adds another causal layer. Reader experiences the fall as multi-determined, not single event.
**Risk:** Can seem mechanical. Here, only two "Ofs" — enough to create pattern without over-determination.

### **Parallelism** (PAIR-uh-lel-iz-um / ˈpærəˌlɛlɪzəm)
**Lines:** L5
**Definition:** Similar grammatical structures in sequence.
**Evidence:** "Restore us, and regain the blissful seat" (verb + object // verb + object).
**Effect:** Syntactic balance implies conceptual equivalence: restoring humanity = regaining paradise. Reader sees two acts as unified.
**Risk:** Can feel overly neat. Milton's iambic rhythm absorbs the parallelism into the pentameter flow.

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus / kaɪˈæzməs) [conceptual]
**Lines:** L1–5
**Definition:** Inverted parallel structure (ABBA).
**Evidence:** Fall (Adam = Man) causes loss; Restoration (Christ = greater Man) causes gain—humanity's descent, divine ascent.
**Effect:** Theological symmetry: as one Man (Adam) lost, one Man (Christ) restores. Reader perceives typological echo.
**Risk:** Conceptual, not verbal—reader must infer the structure. Milton leaves it subliminal.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Radical Periodic Structure / Suspended Syntax**
**Lines:** L1–6
**Signals:**
- Main clause (subject + imperative verb "Sing") delayed until L6.
- Five lines of prepositional phrases and subordinate clauses precede.
- Reader cannot parse sentence grammatically until reaching "Sing."
**Effect on stance:** Syntax forces patience, enacting humanity's long wait (Genesis → Gospels) for redemption. Form embodies theology: suspension is the structure.
**Classical kin:** Ciceronian period, but Milton extends to extreme—6 lines before resolution.

### **Right-Branching Modification (Nested Embedding)**
**Lines:** L1–5
**Signals:**
- "Of Man's first disobedience" → "and the fruit" → "Of that forbidden tree" → "whose mortal taste" → "Brought death into the World" → "and all our woe" → "With loss of Eden" → "till one greater Man" → "Restore us, and regain..."
- Each phrase nests within or extends from previous.
**Effect on time/authority:** Cascading structure mirrors cascading consequences of the Fall. Reader descends syntactically as humanity descended morally.
**Classical kin:** Loose/cumulative sentence (Tufte), but here serving epic gravity, not prose ease.

### **Passive + Agent Deletion (in embedded clauses)**
**Lines:** L4 ("With loss of Eden")
**Signals:**
- Nominalization: "loss" (noun) instead of "lost" (verb).
- No agent specified (who lost? Adam? God? humanity?).
**Effect on stance:** Abstracts agency, presenting Fall's consequences as fait accompli. Reader receives results without actors—historical distance from primal scene.
**Classical kin:** Nominalizing for elevation (turning verbs into abstract nouns).

### **Prepositional Cascade / Preposition-Heavy Syntax**
**Lines:** L1–4
**Signals:**
- Opens with "Of," continues with "Of," "into," "With," "till."
- Prepositions outnumber finite verbs (5 prepositions, 1 main verb).
**Effect on stance:** Locates narrative in conceptual space (of disobedience, of tree, into world, with loss). Reader navigates relations, not actions—static tableau before the command to sing.
**Classical kin:** Latinate prepositional complexity (English mirroring inflected-language syntax).

### **Modal + Infinitive (Futurity)**
**Lines:** L4–5
**Signals:**
- "till one greater Man / Restore us" (bare infinitive after temporal "till").
- No finite tense marker—timeless/prophetic modality.
**Effect on stance:** Redemption presented as certain but not-yet-realized. Reader inhabits moment between Fall (past) and Restoration (future-inevitable).
**Classical kin:** Prophetic present/future collapse in biblical language.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Anglo-Saxon monosyllables anchor the opening: "Man," "first," "fruit," "tree," "death," "World," "woe," "loss"—short, blunt, grounding the theological in the tangible. Latinate polysyllables enter with consequences: "disobedience" (5 syllables), "forbidden" (3), "Restore" (2). The tongue labors through "disobedience" (di-so-BE-di-ence), then drops to the percussive single-beat "Sing."

**Cadence seams:** Iambic pentameter throughout (10 syllables per line, unstressed-stressed pairs). But enjambment fights the metrical boundary—syntax spills over where meter stops, creating tension between form (line) and content (sentence).

**Alliteration:** "fruit / forbidden" (L1–2, /f/ fricative), "Brought...blissful" (L3, L5, /b/ plosive). Soft fricatives give way to harder plosives—sound enacts fall's impact.

**Caesura:** L3: "Brought death into the World, || and all our woe"—comma-pause after "World" (mid-line break). Reader breathes before the second hammer-blow ("woe"). L5: "Restore us, || and regain the blissful seat"—pause after "us" balances the redemptive acts.

**Meter signature:** Iambic pentameter, but L1 opens with trochaic inversion: "OF man's" (stressed-unstressed), violating iambic expectation. The inversion *enacts* disobedience in prosody—the meter itself falls.

**Music argues:** The ear hears theology. Line 1–3 descend (fall); L4–5 ascend (redemption); L6 commands. Pitch contour mirrors narrative arc: low (disobedience) → lower (death) → upward turn (greater Man) → imperative peak (Sing).

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Extreme periodic structure. Skeleton: "Sing [X]." Flesh: Five lines of prepositional/subordinate matter filling [X]. The scaffolding is simple (imperative + object); the execution is labyrinthine.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Heavy subordination. "Of Man's...and the fruit / Of that forbidden tree whose...till one greater Man...and regain..." Only two main coordinates ("and the fruit," "and regain")—rest is nested modification. Effect: Creates syntactic hierarchy mirroring theological hierarchy (Fall → consequences → redemption).

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** None. All modification is postposed or embedded.
- **Embedded:** Relative clause ("whose mortal taste"), temporal clause ("till one greater Man Restore us").
- **Cumulative:** Each phrase extends rightward, building the content before the imperative.

**Inversion:** Entire sentence inverted—object-content placed before subject-verb. Normal order: "Heavenly Muse, sing of Man's first disobedience..." Milton's order: "[Of Man's first disobedience...] Sing, Heavenly Muse."

**Information flow:** Given (L1–5): Here's what to sing about (Fall and Redemption). New (L6): The command to sing. Reader processes content before realizing it's the object of a yet-unstated verb. The delay is the drama.

### Micro-rewrites:

**Compressed:** *"Muse, sing of Adam's sin—the fruit that brought death and lost Eden—till Christ restores us to paradise."*
**Lost:** Periodic suspense, enjambment's line-by-line revelation, iambic pentameter, "greater Man" typology, "blissful seat" concreteness. Irony: compression gains clarity but loses epic gravity. Current version's sprawl *is* the epic stance.

**Dilated:** *"Of the first disobedience of Man, and likewise of the fruit taken from that tree which was forbidden, whose taste was mortal and brought death into the World and all our sorrows and woes, together with the loss of the garden of Eden, until such time as one greater Man shall come to restore us and to regain for us that blissful seat from which we fell—all this, Heavenly Muse, I command thee to sing."*
**Lost:** Compression's power, enjambment, metrical integrity. Dilution buries the skeleton. Current version is dense but not flabby.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Ambiguous. "Man's first disobedience" (L1) = historical past (Genesis). "till one greater Man / Restore us" (L4–5) = prophetic future (Gospels). "Sing" (L6) = imperative present. Reader stands at temporal crossroads—narrating past and future simultaneously.

**Aspect:**
- "disobedience" (L1): Nominal form (stative) = completed action now static fact.
- "Brought death" (L3): Simple past (perfective) = completed, irreversible.
- "Restore us, and regain" (L5): Bare infinitives after "till" = future-certain but not-yet-realized (prospective aspect).
- "Sing" (L6): Imperative (atemporal) = command existing outside time.

**Modality:**
- "must" absent, but "till" (L4) implies inevitability (epistemic certainty of redemption).
- Imperative "Sing" = deontic modality (poet commands the muse, asserting authority).

**Quoted locus:** "till one greater Man / Restore us" (L4–5)—temporal conjunction "till" + bare infinitive (no "will," no "shall"). Creates prophetic certainty without finite verb. Effect: Redemption is timeless promise, not datable event.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Consumption/Ingestion:** "fruit," "taste"—sin as eating, knowledge as swallowing.
2. **Spatiality:** "into the World," "Eden," "blissful seat"—fall as movement downward, redemption as return upward.
3. **Possession/Exchange:** "loss," "Restore," "regain"—theological economy of losing and recovering paradise.

**Lexical fields:**
- **Moral-legal:** "disobedience," "forbidden"—sin as law-breaking.
- **Mortality:** "mortal," "death," "woe"—fall's consequence as death-entry.
- **Edenic-botanical:** "fruit," "tree," "Eden"—paradise as garden.
- **Redemptive-theological:** "greater Man," "Restore," "regain," "blissful seat"—salvation as spatial and ontological recovery.

**Image logic in six lines:** Fall = eating forbidden fruit = death entering spatial realm (World) = loss of Edenic seat. Redemption = greater Man acting (no consumption imagery—Christ *is* consumed, but Milton elides it here) = restoring humanity = regaining seat. The logic: downward consumption → loss; upward restoration → recovery.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Extradiegetic narrator (Genette) = epic voice outside story. But invocation complicates: narrator petitions muse, positioning himself *below* divine source. Psychic distance: Maximal from characters (Adam unmentioned by name), minimal from cosmic perspective (narrator sees Fall and Redemption as unified arc).

**Time (Genette):**
- **Order:** Anachrony. Covers Genesis (past), incarnation/resurrection (narrative-present or future), and poet's present (imperative "Sing").
- **Duration:** Six lines summarize millennia—extreme summary (Genette's "summary" mode).
- **Frequency:** Singulative: one telling of unique events (Fall, Redemption).

**Beat structure:** Setup (L1–3: Fall) → Complication (L3: consequences) → Reversal (L4–5: Redemption) → Call to Action (L6: Sing). Reader moves through theological history in six lines, then realizes she's been in the object clause of an imperative.

**Subtext:** What's unspoken? Eve. "Man's first disobedience" elides her agency—Adam synecdoche erases the woman who ate first. Reader who notices absence enters centuries of exegetical debate about blame.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Built through invocation and allusion. Milton claims epic lineage (Homer, Virgil) while asserting Christian superiority (Heavenly Muse > pagan muses). Reader trusts poet who positions himself as divine conduit, not personal voice.

**Pathos:** Restrained but present. "all our woe" (L3)—possessive "our" implicates reader in the Fall. Not Adam's woe but *ours*. Emotional strategy: collective guilt, collective hope. "Restore *us*" (L5)—reader is addressee of redemption.

**Logos:** Theological syllogism embedded in syntax:
(1) Adam's disobedience brought death/loss. [L1–4]
(2) Christ will restore/regain paradise. [L4–5]
(3) Therefore, sing this story. [L6]
The logic is causal and temporal: Fall → consequence → redemption → imperative to narrate.

**Lines:** "till one greater Man / Restore us" (L4–5)—"till" (temporal) implies inevitability. Not "if" or "perhaps" but "*till*"—restoration is logically/theologically certain.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Homer / Virgil (epic invocation):** "Sing, Goddess" (*Iliad*); "I sing of arms and the man" (*Aeneid*). Milton inherits invocation-as-opening but Christianizes: Heavenly Muse (Holy Spirit?) replaces pagan Calliope. Syntax mimics classical but content Christianizes form.

**Dante (*Divine Comedy*):** Opens with "Nel mezzo del cammin" (journey mid-begun). Milton follows: invocation before narrative, positioning poet as pilgrim needing divine guidance. Syntax establishes humility before claiming audacity.

**Biblical prophets (Isaiah, Ezekiel):** "Thus saith the Lord"—imperative divine speech. Milton inverts: he commands the Muse, but the command is itself subordination (muse must sing *through* him).

**English blank verse (Marlowe, Shakespeare):** Iambic pentameter without rhyme. Milton perfects unrhymed epic line, using enjambment to prevent couplet-closure feel. Syntax sprawls across lines, refusing dramatic-verse's end-stopped clarity.

**Subversion:** Where Homer/Virgil invoke muses decoratively (convention), Milton's invocation is theologically necessary—he *cannot* sing without divine breath. Syntax enacts dependence: the poet disappears into the commanded act.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots:
1. **"Man's first disobedience"** (L1) — "first" is load-bearing: implies subsequent disobediences, and Christ's first *obedience* (typology). Reader hears theological echo in single adjective.
2. **"whose mortal taste"** (L2) — Adjective transfer: "mortal" modifies "taste" (grammatically) but means "deadly" (semantically). Syntax compresses: taste *brings* mortality, *is* mortal.
3. **"till one greater Man"** (L4) — Comparative "greater" without explicit comparison. Greater than whom? Adam (unstated but implied). Syntax makes reader supply the missing term—active reading required.
4. **"Sing, Heavenly Muse"** (L6) — Imperative + vocative. The command seems presumptuous (human ordering divine?) but "Heavenly" acknowledges hierarchy. Syntax embeds humility in assertion.

### Faultlines:
1. **"and the fruit / Of that forbidden tree"** (L1–2) — "and" links "disobedience" and "fruit" as if separate, but they're the same event. **Fix:** Remove "and" ("Of Man's first disobedience, the fruit / Of that..."). **Shift:** Loses polysyndeton's accumulative feel; gains tighter apposition. Current version treats act and object as related-but-distinct.
2. **"and all our woe"** (L3) — After the singular "death into the World," "all our woe" feels plural-vague. **Fix:** Specify ("and grief and pain and loss"). **Shift:** Gains concreteness, loses one-word compression. "Woe" is old-fashioned but carries biblical weight.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

### Subtraction test:
**Remove:** "and the fruit / Of that forbidden tree" (L1–2)
**Result:** "Of Man's first disobedience, whose mortal taste / Brought death into the World..."
**Loss:** Fruit image (concrete ground for abstraction). "Whose" now lacks clear antecedent. The tree matters—metonymy of fruit carries symbolic weight (Genesis 3). Current version needs it.

### Amplification test:
**Heighten:** Add third element to Fall consequences
**Result:** "Brought death into the World, and all our woe, / With loss of Eden, and perpetual exile..."
**Gain:** Tricolon (three-part list), fuller consequence catalog. **Risk:** Over-determines. Current version stops at "loss of Eden," then pivots to redemption—tight turn is better than exhaustive list.

### Register shift (formal ↔ colloquial):
**Formal (even more):** "Concerning the primordial transgression of Mankind, and furthermore concerning the produce of that arboreal entity which had been prohibited, whose gustatory experience, being of mortal consequence, did introduce the phenomenon of mortality into the terrestrial sphere, together with the entirety of our lamentation, accompanied by the forfeiture of the Edenic demesne, until such time as a superior exemplar of Humanity shall effect our restitution and recover the felicitous throne—these matters, O Celestial Muse, do thou vocalize."
**Effect:** Parody. Over-Latinate, over-subordinated. Milton is elevated but not unreadable; this crosses into self-parody.

**Colloquial:** "Sing, Muse, about Adam eating the forbidden fruit—how it brought death and misery and made us lose paradise, till Jesus saves us and gets heaven back."
**Effect:** Bathetic collapse. Loses periodic suspense, iambic pentameter, enjambment, metonymy. Gains nothing—Milton's syntax *is* his meaning.

### Punctuation swap:
**Comma → Period:** "Of Man's first disobedience. And the fruit / Of that forbidden tree..."
**Effect:** Breaks into fragments, losing periodic structure. Sentence no longer suspends—becomes paratactic list. Kills the effect entirely.

**Comma → Em-dash:** "Brought death into the World—and all our woe— / With loss of Eden—till one greater Man / Restore us—and regain the blissful seat— / Sing, Heavenly Muse..."
**Effect:** Dashes add dramatic pause/emphasis, modernizing the rhythm. Gains urgency, loses 17th-century stateliness. More Romantic, less Miltonic.

### Focalization nudge:
**Current:** Extradiegetic, addressing Muse.
**Closer (addressing reader):** "Hear how Man's first disobedience brought death and loss, till one greater Man restored us—hear this, reader, and understand."
**Effect:** Direct address makes reader present, but loses epic distance and muse-invocation tradition. Becomes didactic rather than prophetic.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

### Imitatio (new content, same scaffolding):
*Of Woman's first defiance, and the word / Of that forbidden speech whose mortal sound / Brought silence into history, and all our doubt, / With loss of voice, till one greater Woman / Restore us, and reclaim the rightful throne, / Sing, Forgotten Muse...*

**Replicates:** Periodic structure (prepositional opening → imperative command); enjambment at key words ("word / Of that," "sound / Brought"); polysyndeton ("and...and"); typology ("Woman" / "greater Woman"); redemptive trajectory (loss → restoration); iambic pentameter.

### Counter-Imitatio (same content, opposing scaffolding):
*Muse, sing! Adam disobeyed. He ate the fruit. The tree was forbidden. Its taste brought death. We lost Eden. We suffer. But Christ will restore us. He'll regain paradise. So sing, Muse.*

**Opposes:** Paratactic fragments replace periodic suspension; imperative moved to opening (no delay); enjambment eliminated (end-stopped lines); polysyndeton removed; simple past replaces nominalizations; short sentences replace sprawl.

### Compression (≤25 words):
*Sing, Muse, of Adam's disobedience—fruit whose taste brought death and lost Eden—till Christ restores us and regains paradise.*

**Keeps:** Invocation, Fall, consequence, redemption, imperative. **Loses:** Periodic structure (main clause comes first now), enjambment, five-line buildup, "greater Man" typology, "blissful seat" concreteness, iambic pentameter.

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. **Suspend your main verb till the end; make the reader wait for grammatical resolution.** (Periodic structure as theology)
2. **Use prepositional cascade to locate action in conceptual space before naming action.** ("Of...Of...into...With...till" before "Sing")
3. **Let enjambment fight meter; syntax vs. line = tension.** (Spill meaning across boundaries)
4. **Employ typology through comparative adjectives without stating the comparison.** ("greater Man" implies lesser Man = Adam)
5. **Nominalize actions to create static, monumental facts.** ("disobedience" not "disobeyed")
6. **Embed redemption *within* the fall narrative; show the arc in syntax.** (Fall → till redemption → command)
7. **Command the muse while subordinating yourself to divine source.** (Imperative as humility)
