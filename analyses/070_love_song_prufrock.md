## Author and Source

> Let us go then, you and I,
> When the evening is spread out against the sky
> Like a patient etherized upon a table

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* Evening "Like a patient etherized upon a table"
*Effect:* Shocking comparison; makes romantic cliché disturbing.

### **Enjambment** (en-JAM-ment)
*Definition:* Sentence continuing across line breaks.
*Example:* All three lines connect syntactically.
*Effect:* Creates forward momentum; syntax doesn't pause for line endings.

### **Direct Address** (duh-REKT uh-DRES)
*Definition:* Speaking to specific addressee.
*Example:* "you and I"
*Effect:* Creates intimacy; implicates reader in journey.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Cohortative Imperative
"Let us go"—**first person plural imperative** suggests mutual action. Not "I will go" or "You should go" but "Let US go"—syntax creates partnership.

### Temporal Adverb
"then"—suggests this follows from something (unstated). Syntax implies previous conversation or thought.

### Appositive Pronouns
"you and I"—**appositives** to "us," making explicit who "us" includes. Creates intimacy through grammatical specification.

### Temporal Clause
"When the evening is spread out"—**subordinate temporal clause** sets scene. The **passive voice** "is spread out" makes evening the patient, not agent.

### Shocking Simile
"Like a patient etherized upon a table"—**prepositional phrase** introduces simile that subverts romantic expectations. Syntax is conventional (Like X upon Y) but content is modernist shock.

The **past participle "etherized"** suggests medical procedure, unconsciousness. Syntax through verb choice transforms romantic evening into clinical scene.

### Stylistic Effect
Through cohortative imperative, passive patient-evening, and clinical simile, Eliot creates modernist anti-romanticism. Form performs disillusion—syntax that sets up romantic expectation (evening against sky) then violates it through simile. Grammar as modernist shock.
