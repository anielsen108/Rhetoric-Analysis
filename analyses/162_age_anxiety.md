# Passage 162: "The Age of Anxiety"

## Author and Source
**W.H. Auden**, *The Age of Anxiety* (1947)

## Passage
> We would rather be ruined than changed,
> We would rather die in our dread
> Than climb the cross of the moment
> And let our illusions die.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "We would rather...We would rather"
*Effect:* Hammers home collective preference for destruction.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "ruined" vs. "changed"; "die" vs. "climb"
*Effect:* Shows perverse preference for known destruction over transformative effort.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* "cross of the moment" - temporal experience as crucifixion.
*Effect:* Makes present suffering into religious trial.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Illusions that can "die"
*Effect:* Makes false beliefs into living entities.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Modal Preference
"We would rather be ruined"—**modal auxiliary** with comparative. Syntax shows active choice for destruction.

### Passive Destruction
"be ruined"—**passive infinitive**. Syntax removes agency from ruin.

### Adversative Comparison
"than changed"—**comparative conjunction** with passive participle. Syntax makes change the rejected alternative.

### Parallel Modal
"We would rather die"—**repeated modal preference**. Syntax reinforces collective choice.

### Prepositional Emotion
"in our dread"—**locative preposition** with possessive. Syntax makes fear a place of dwelling.

### Infinitive Challenge
"Than climb the cross"—**infinitive** with metaphorical object. Syntax makes alternative active, effortful.

### Genitive Temporality
"of the moment"—**genitive specification**. Syntax makes present time the crucifixion.

### Coordinate Refusal
"And let our illusions die"—**coordinating conjunction** with causative verb. Syntax adds second required sacrifice.

### Possessive Illusions
"our illusions"—**possessive with abstract noun**. Syntax shows attachment to false beliefs.

### Stylistic Effect
Through anaphoric modal preference, passive ruination, adversative rejection of change, repeated death-choice, prepositional dwelling-in-dread, infinitive cross-climbing challenge, temporal genitive, and coordinate letting-illusions-die, Auden creates syntax of existential cowardice—grammar that indicts collective human preference for familiar destruction over transformative struggle required by present moment.
