# Passage 161: "All the King's Men"

## Author and Source
**Robert Penn Warren**, *All the King's Men* (1946)

## Passage
> But now I don't know. I only know that there is no one else to do what has to be done, and that I am the one who has to do it.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "I only know...and that I am..."
*Effect:* Creates parallel certainties after uncertainty.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "now I don't know" vs. "I only know"
*Effect:* Contrasts epistemological uncertainty with practical certainty.

### **Tautology** (taw-TAH-luh-jee)
*Definition:* Saying same thing twice.
*Example:* "no one else...I am the one"
*Effect:* Emphasizes isolation through logical redundancy.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Adversative Opening
"But now"—**coordinating conjunction** with temporal adverb. Syntax signals reversal from prior belief.

### Epistemic Negation
"I don't know"—**negated cognitive verb**. Syntax admits uncertainty.

### Restrictive Adverb
"I only know"—**limiting adverb** with cognitive verb. Syntax narrows certainty to single claim.

### Nominal Clause Object
"that there is no one else"—**subordinate clause** with existential negative. Syntax makes absence the known fact.

### Infinitive Necessity
"to do what has to be done"—**purpose infinitive** with passive necessity. Syntax shows impersonal obligation.

### Relative Clause Vagueness
"what has to be done"—**interrogative relative** without specifics. Syntax keeps action unnamed.

### Coordinate Tautology
"and that I am the one"—**parallel subordinate clause**. Syntax restates first claim as personal responsibility.

### Relative Clause Redundancy
"who has to do it"—**restrictive relative** with modal necessity. Syntax completes tautological circle.

### Stylistic Effect
Through adversative now-reversal, epistemic negation, restrictive only-knowing, existential no-one-else, vague what-has-to-be-done infinitive, and tautological I-am-the-one-who-has-to-do-it, Warren creates syntax of reluctant necessity—grammar showing how narrator moves from uncertainty to burden through logical elimination, where duty emerges not from knowledge but from absence of alternatives.
