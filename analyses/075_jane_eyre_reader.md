> Reader, I married him.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Direct Address** (duh-REKT uh-DRES)
*Definition:* Speaking directly to audience.
*Example:* "Reader"
*Effect:* Breaks fourth wall; creates intimacy; makes reader confidant.

### **Brevity** (BREV-ih-tee)
*Definition:* Extreme compression.
*Example:* Three words for major plot point.
*Effect:* Makes momentous event seem simple, inevitable.

### **Understatement** (UN-der-state-ment)
*Definition:* Deliberate restraint.
*Example:* Simple declaration instead of elaborate description.
*Effect:* Lets simplicity carry weight; trusts reader to understand significance.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Vocative Opening
"Reader"—**noun in vocative case** (direct address) begins sentence. The syntax doesn't say "Dear Reader" or "My Reader," just "Reader"—familiar, direct.

### Subject-Verb-Object
"I married him"—**simple past tense**, **active voice**, **transitive verb**. This is maximally simple English sentence structure: subject + verb + object.

### Pronoun Choice
"him"—the **object pronoun** without name assumes reader knows who "him" is (Rochester). Syntax through pronoun creates intimacy—no need to specify; we're in this together.

### Sentence Length
**Three words** for the novel's climactic event. After hundreds of pages, this is the resolution. The **syntactic compression** is extraordinary—no elaboration, no description, just fact.

### Punctuation
The **period** (not exclamation point, not semicolon leading to more) creates finality. Syntax through punctuation says: this is complete, this is enough.

### Tense Choice
**Simple past "married"** (not "have married" or "was married"). The syntax chooses definite past action, completed, done.

### Active Voice
"I married him" (not "I was married to him" or "We were married"). The syntax makes Jane the grammatical subject and agent—she acts, she chooses.

### Stylistic Effect
Through direct address, radical compression, and active voice, Brontë creates one of literature's most famous sentences. Form IS the triumph—syntax so simple it's revolutionary. After a novel about Jane's quest for agency, the grammar gives her complete agency: subject, actor, chooser. Three words that contain a novel's worth of meaning through their very simplicity.
