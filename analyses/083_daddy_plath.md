## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Epizeuxis** (eh-pih-ZOOK-sis)
*Definition:* Immediate repetition.
*Example:* "You do not do, you do not do"
*Effect:* Creates childlike sing-song; emphasizes finality.

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* "lived like a foot"
*Effect:* Renders speaker trapped, controlled by the shoe.

### **Slant Rhyme** (SLANT-RYME)
*Definition:* Approximate rhyme.
*Example:* "do/shoe," "white/Achoo"
*Effect:* Creates nursery-rhyme effect; makes horror childlike.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* "thirty years...barely daring to breathe"
*Effect:* Intensifies suffocation of patriarchal oppression.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Emphatic Negation
"You do not do"—**auxiliary DO with not** creates emphatic negation. Syntax performs rejection through repetition.

### Address Without Name
"You"—**second person pronoun** without antecedent creates direct address. Syntax confronts addressee immediately.

### Metaphoric Apposition
"black shoe / In which I have lived"—**noun followed by relative clause**. The shoe becomes dwelling through syntax.

### Comparative Clause
"like a foot"—**prepositional phrase of comparison**. Syntax makes speaker mere appendage trapped in father's boot.

### Present Perfect Duration
"I have lived...For thirty years"—**present perfect with duration**. Syntax emphasizes ongoing entrapment continuing to present.

### Comic Relief Through Rhyme
"Achoo"—**nonsense word forced to rhyme**. Syntax breaks into childish sound, mixing trauma with nursery rhyme.

### Stylistic Effect
Through emphatic negation, present perfect duration, and forced rhyme, Plath creates syntax of childlike confrontation—grammar that speaks trauma through nursery-rhyme rhythms.
