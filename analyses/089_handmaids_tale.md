# Passage 089: "The Handmaid's Tale"

## Author and Source
**Margaret Atwood**, *The Handmaid's Tale* (1985)

## Passage
> Night falls. Or has fallen. Why is it that night falls, instead of rising, like the dawn? Yet if you look east, at sunset, you can see night rising, not falling; darkness lifting into the sky, up from the horizon.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Correctio** (kor-REK-tee-oh)
*Definition:* Self-correction.
*Example:* "Night falls. Or has fallen."
*Effect:* Creates uncertainty about time and observation.

### **Rhetorical Question** (rih-TOR-ih-kul KWES-chun)
*Definition:* Question not requiring answer.
*Example:* "Why is it that night falls, instead of rising?"
*Effect:* Challenges linguistic convention; makes reader reconsider assumptions.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "falling" vs. "rising"; "darkness lifting...up from horizon"
*Effect:* Inverts expected metaphor; makes darkness ascend.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Intransitive Verb
"Night falls"—**subject-verb**, simple present. Syntax uses conventional metaphor.

### Perfect Tense Correction
"Or has fallen"—**present perfect** suggests completion at unspecified time. Syntax introduces temporal uncertainty.

### Interrogative Why
"Why is it that night falls"—**cleft sentence** in interrogative form. Syntax foregrounds the question, making familiar phrase strange.

### Adversative Yet
"Yet if you look east"—**conditional clause** introduced by adversative. Syntax pivots from question to observation that contradicts convention.

### Participial Reversal
"darkness lifting into the sky, up from the horizon"—**present participle** with directional prepositionals. Syntax reverses expected downward motion.

### Stylistic Effect
Through tense uncertainty, rhetorical questioning of idiom, and syntactic reversal of rising/falling, Atwood creates grammar of resistance—language that questions even basic metaphors, refusing to accept conventional descriptions of reality.
