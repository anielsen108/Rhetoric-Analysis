# Passage 176: "Atonement"

## Author and Source
**Ian McEwan**, *Atonement* (2001)

## Passage
> The scene by the fountain, its air of ugly threat, and at the heart of it, her older sister, her back arched, her arm upraised, made Briony's writing ambitions, which were to be a post office clerk, seem childish.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh)
*Definition:* Verb governing different objects.
*Example:* "made...ambitions...seem childish" - single verb controlling complex subjects.
*Effect:* Links observed scene to internal transformation.

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions.
*Example:* "her back arched, her arm upraised"
*Effect:* Creates snapshot effect, frozen moment.

### **Prolepsis** (proh-LEP-sis)
*Definition:* Anticipation of objection.
*Example:* Specifying "which were to be a post office clerk"
*Effect:* Retrospectively mocks earlier limited ambition.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Nominal Subject
"The scene by the fountain"—**definite noun phrase**. Syntax makes visual moment into grammatical agent.

### Appositive Quality
"its air of ugly threat"—**possessive with abstract noun**. Syntax attributes atmospheric menace.

### Prepositional Core
"at the heart of it"—**spatial metaphor**. Syntax identifies central element.

### Appositive Sister
"her older sister"—**possessive with familial noun**. Syntax names central figure.

### Absolute Phrases
"her back arched, her arm upraised"—**two absolute constructions**. Syntax creates participial snapshot of frozen pose.

### Complex Subject
Long subject before verb. Syntax delays main action.

### Transitive Making
"made...seem"—**causative verb** with copular complement. Syntax shows how observation transforms self-perception.

### Possessive Ambitions
"Briony's writing ambitions"—**genitive with compound noun**. Syntax names what's being transformed.

### Relative Clause Specification
"which were to be a post office clerk"—**restrictive relative** revealing modest goal. Syntax exposes limitation retrospectively.

### Copular Judgment
"seem childish"—**copulative complement**. Syntax completes transformation from serious to immature.

### Stylistic Effect
Through nominal scene-as-subject, appositive atmospheric threat, spatial at-heart location, absolute arched-back/upraised-arm frozen-pose phrases, delayed causative made-seem verb, and relative clause exposing modest post-office ambitions, McEwan creates syntax of transformative observation—grammar showing how witnessing sexual tension instantaneously renders child's modest aspirations inadequate, performance of single moment changing narrator's self-concept.
