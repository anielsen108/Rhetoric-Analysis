# Passage 125: "The First Time Caesar Approached Cora"

## Author and Source
**Colson Whitehead**, *The Underground Railroad* (2016)

## Passage
> The first time Caesar approached Cora about running north, she said no. This was her grandmother's plantation. She had been born here; her mother and grandmother were buried there. All she knew of the world was right here.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "her...her...her" and "she...She...she"
*Effect:* Emphasizes Cora's rootedness through repetition.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Apparent contradiction.
*Example:* Calling enslaved land "her grandmother's plantation"
*Effect:* Shows how ownership language fails to describe slave reality.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild term for harsh reality.
*Example:* "her grandmother's plantation" for site of enslavement.
*Effect:* Reveals how Cora conceptualizes captivity through family connection.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Temporal Opening
"The first time"—**definite article with ordinal**. Syntax implies later persuasion.

### Simple Past Rejection
"she said no"—**subject-verb-negative**. Syntax makes refusal stark, absolute.

### Demonstrative Possession
"This was her grandmother's plantation"—**demonstrative pronoun** with genitive. Syntax claims connection to place of bondage.

### Passive Birth
"She had been born here"—**past perfect passive**. Syntax emphasizes location over agency.

### Burial Passive
"were buried there"—**passive construction** for death. Syntax makes ancestors part of land.

### Universal Quantifier
"All she knew"—**universal quantifier** with relative clause. Syntax makes world coextensive with plantation.

### Deictic "here/there"
"here...there...right here"—**spatial deictics** repeated. Syntax anchors Cora to specific place.

### Copulative Confinement
"was right here"—**copula with emphatic spatial adverb**. Syntax equates world with plantation.

### Stylistic Effect
Through temporal opening implying future change, stark past-tense refusal, possessive language applied to slavery, spatial deictics anchoring to place, and universal quantifier making plantation the entire world, Whitehead creates syntax of constrained consciousness—grammar showing how enslavement limits both physical movement and imaginative possibility.
