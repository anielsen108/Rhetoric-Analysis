# Passage 157: "The Grapes of Wrath"

## Author and Source
**John Steinbeck**, *The Grapes of Wrath* (1939)

## Passage
> And the women came out of the houses to stand beside their men—to feel whether this time the men would break.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "to stand...to feel"
*Effect:* Creates parallel purposes, layered motivations.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "break" for psychological/spiritual collapse.
*Effect:* Uses physical metaphor for mental devastation.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-ECK-duh-kee)
*Definition:* Part for whole.
*Example:* "their men" for husbands/fathers/brothers.
*Effect:* Defines male family members by gender role.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Coordinating Conjunction Opening
"And"—**coordinating conjunction** beginning sentence. Syntax connects to previous events, part of ongoing narrative.

### Definite Collective
"the women"—**definite article** with collective noun. Syntax makes women universal group, not individuals.

### Directional Preposition
"out of the houses"—**ablative preposition** showing emergence. Syntax makes houses containers women leave.

### Infinitive Purpose
"to stand beside their men"—**purpose infinitive** with spatial preposition. Syntax makes standing deliberate act.

### Deictic Demonstrative
"this time"—**temporal demonstrative**. Syntax acknowledges repeated trials.

### Potential Modality
"would break"—**modal auxiliary** of prediction. Syntax shows uncertainty about male resilience.

### Hypotactic Purpose Chain
"to stand...to feel...whether...would break"—**nested infinitives and subordinate clause**. Syntax embeds true purpose beneath surface action.

### Stylistic Effect
Through coordinating narrative continuity, collective definite women, ablative house-emergence, infinitive standing-purpose, demonstrative repeated-trial, and nested hypotactic chain leading to modal prediction of male breaking, Steinbeck creates syntax of gendered endurance—grammar showing how women monitor men's psychological survival through Depression trials.
