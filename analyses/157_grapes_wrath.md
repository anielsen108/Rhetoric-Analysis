# Passage 157: Watching the Men (*The Grapes of Wrath*)

**John Steinbeck** · *The Grapes of Wrath* · 1939 | Chapter 1 intercalary section

**Occasion/Pressure:** Dust Bowl families face another crisis; women monitor men's resolve to see if hope will hold.
**Persona/Stance:** Impersonal narrator channeling collective consciousness—biblical cadence, communal focus.
**Thesis of Effect:** Initial conjunction, collective nouns, and infinitive purpose clauses expose the silent ritual: women testing whether the men’s spirit will break again.

---

## PASSAGE

[L1] And the women came out of the houses to stand beside their men—to feel whether this time the men would break.

---

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh / əˈnæfərə)
**Evidence:** "to stand…to feel."
**Effect:** Parallel purposes reveal layered intention—public solidarity vs. private diagnosis.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for / ˈmɛtəfɔːr)
**Evidence:** "men would break" equates morale with brittle object.
**Effect:** Suggests psychological fracture as physical shattering.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-EK-duh-kee / sɪˈnɛkdəki)
**Evidence:** "the women" and "their men" stand for entire community.
**Effect:** Gender roles become representative units of family.

### **Epanorthosis (self-correction)**
**Evidence:** Dash introduces second infinitive clarifying true motive.
**Effect:** Narrative reveals deeper intention behind apparent support.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Initial Coordination**
**Evidence:** Sentence opens with "And."
**Effect:** Biblical chain; story feels continuous, ongoing.

### **Infinitive Purpose Chain**
**Evidence:** "to stand…to feel…"
**Effect:** Exposes layered motivation; first action (stand) masks second (diagnose).

### **Subordinate "whether" Clause**
**Evidence:** "whether this time the men would break."
**Effect:** Introduces conditional suspense; women judge outcome.

### **Dash Insertion**
**Evidence:** "men—to feel…"
**Effect:** Dash mimics pause where observers reassess reason for gathering.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Collective Definiteness**
**Signals:** "the women," "the men."
**Effect:** Groups treated as archetypes; individuals dissolve into communal roles.

### **Spatial Release**
**Signals:** "came out of the houses."
**Effect:** Domestic interior yields to public crisis watch.

### **Modal Uncertainty**
**Signals:** "would break."
**Effect:** Future-in-the-past expresses anxiety; outcome unknown yet feared.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Heavy stresses on "And" "women" "men" deliver drumbeat cadence.

**Cadence seams:** Dash introduces hushed aside; sentence slows at "to feel".

**Alliteration:** "men—to…men" echo underscores focus.

**Music argues:** Sentence moves from march-like emergence to tense, suspended finale.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Single cumulative sentence with dash-inserted purpose clause.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** Coordinating "And" ties to prior scene.
- **Mid:** Infinitive phrase "to stand" follows main action.
- **Postposed:** Dash + second infinitive + "whether" clause deliver hidden purpose.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Minimal coordination; primary subordination occurs via infinitives and "whether." 

**Information flow:** Women emerge → show solidarity → reveal true aim → question male endurance.

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"And the women came out to stand by their men and feel if this time they would break."* — Loses dash tension.
- **Dilated:** *"And out of the houses the women stepped, positioning themselves beside their men so that they might sense, this time, whether the men would fracture."* — More formal, less biblical.

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Community vantage; no individual pronouns.

**Aspect:** Simple past narrates habitual ritual.

**Modality:** "would" indicates potential fracture; outcome uncertain.

**Temporal logic:** "this time" acknowledges repeated crises.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Structural integrity:** men as beams that might break.
2. **Gathering ritual:** women exiting houses.

**Lexical fields:** Domestic space, solidarity, fragility.

**Image logic:** Women as stabilizers testing load-bearing men.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Objective narrator summarizing communal dynamics.

**Time:** Intercalary description generalizing across moments.

**Beat structure:** Emergence → positioning → silent evaluation.

**Subtext:** Women's hope relies on men's resilience; gender interplay determines family's survival.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Narrator conveys authority by describing ritual known to all migrants.

**Pathos:** Implied fear that men might fail evokes empathy for women guarding hope.

**Logos:** Sentence explains social logic: if men stand firm, families continue; if not, despair spreads.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Biblical cadences** reminiscent of Old Testament enumerations.

**Naturalist observation** of group behavior akin to Zola.

**Depression-era reportage** capturing gendered resilience (cf. Dorothea Lange photographs).

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"came out of the houses"** — movement from private to public.
2. **"stand beside"** — solidarity posture.
3. **"this time"** — ongoing struggle.

### Faultlines
1. **Essentialized gender roles** risk stereotyping; Steinbeck uses archetype intentionally.
2. **Dash** can be misinterpreted as optional; it's crucial for tension.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove dash phrase; sentence becomes simple, loses psychological insight.

**Amplification test:** Add "with their hands in aprons"—adds detail but might soften seriousness.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"And the women emerged…"*
- **Colloquial:** *"And the women came out to stand by their men, to check if this time they'd crack."*

**Punctuation swap:** Replace dash with comma—less drama, reduces aside's weight.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *And the children clustered near their mothers to hear whether the voices of the men would harden or falter.*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *The women came out and stood by the men to see if they would break.* — Flat, lacks ritual sense.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *And the women came out to stand beside their men—to sense whether, this time, the men’s spirits would break.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Begin with "And" to place scene within ongoing communal saga.
2. Use infinitive pairs to separate surface action from hidden motive.
3. Let a dash reveal subtext mid-sentence.
4. Employ collective nouns to frame archetypal roles.
5. Harness modal "would" to express feared future.
6. Anchor emotional tension in simple physical gestures.
7. Insert "this time" to convey repeated trials.
