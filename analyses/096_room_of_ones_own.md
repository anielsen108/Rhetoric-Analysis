# Passage 096: "A Room of One's Own"

## Author and Source
**Virginia Woolf**, *A Room of One's Own* (1929)

## Passage
> A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction; and that, as you will see, leaves the great problem of the true nature of woman and the true nature of fiction unsolved.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Parallelism** (pair-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structures.
*Example:* "the true nature of woman and the true nature of fiction"
*Effect:* Links woman and fiction as equally mysterious, equally constructed.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* Problem "unsolved" (understatement of immense complexity).
*Effect:* Dryly acknowledges what material conditions can't resolve.

### **Parenthesis** (puh-REN-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Insertion of aside.
*Example:* "as you will see"
*Effect:* Creates conversational intimacy with reader.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Modal Necessity
"A woman must have"—**modal auxiliary** expressing requirement. Syntax makes material conditions prerequisite.

### Coordinate Objects
"money and a room of her own"—**two noun phrases** coordinated. Syntax links financial and spatial independence.

### Conditional If-Clause
"if she is to write fiction"—**subordinate conditional** with infinitive of purpose. Syntax makes creativity dependent on material conditions.

### Demonstrative Pronoun
"and that, as you will see"—**demonstrative pronoun** refers forward. Syntax creates suspense about consequences.

### Parenthetical Aside
"as you will see"—**interpolated clause** addresses reader directly. Syntax breaks fourth wall, creates lecture intimacy.

### Compound Object (Repeated Pattern)
"the true nature of woman and the true nature of fiction"—**two parallel noun phrases** with repeated "true nature of." Syntax links essentialist questions.

### Participial Conclusion
"leaves...unsolved"—**verb with past participle complement**. Syntax emphasizes incompleteness despite material solutions.

### Stylistic Effect
Through modal necessity, conditional syntax, parenthetical intimacy, and parallel construction linking woman and fiction, Woolf creates grammar of materialist feminism—syntax that grounds creativity in economics while acknowledging unresolved mysteries.
