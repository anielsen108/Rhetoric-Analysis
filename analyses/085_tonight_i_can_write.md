## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Apostrophe** (uh-PAH-struh-fee)
*Definition:* Direct address (here to self/reader).
*Example:* "Write, for example"
*Effect:* Makes writing process visible; creates intimacy.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to non-human.
*Example:* Stars "shiver"
*Effect:* Projects speaker's emotional state onto cosmos.

### **Polyptoton** (pah-LIP-tuh-tahn)
*Definition:* Repetition of word in different forms.
*Example:* "write...Write...write"
*Effect:* Emphasizes act of composition; makes poetry self-reflexive.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Modal Ability
"I can write"—**modal auxiliary** expressing capability. Syntax suggests prior inability—tonight grief becomes articulable.

### Superlative Object
"the saddest lines"—**superlative adjective** modifying object. Syntax makes this ultimate expression of sorrow.

### Imperative Self-Address
"Write, for example"—**imperative mood** addressed to self. Syntax performs composition before reader.

### Nested Quotation
"'The night is starry'"—**quoted sentence within poem**. Syntax creates frame within frame, poem about writing poem.

### Coordinate Clauses
"the stars are blue and shiver"—**two predicates** joined by conjunction. Syntax links color with motion, making stars empathetic.

### Spatial Distance
"in the distance"—**prepositional phrase** emphasizes remoteness. Syntax places beauty beyond reach.

### Stylistic Effect
Through modal transformation (cannot write → can write), imperative self-address, and nested quotation, Neruda creates syntax of grief becoming poetry—grammar that performs the very composition it describes.
