# Passage 014: The Sound and the Fury - Benjy's Section

**William Faulkner** · *The Sound and the Fury* · 1929 | Part I, opening

**Occasion/Pressure:** Novel's threshold; must establish narrator whose consciousness is radically other without explaining or pathologizing.
**Persona/Stance:** First-person present-experience; intellectually disabled narrator (33-year-old with cognition of 3-year-old); no self-awareness of limitation.
**Thesis of Effect:** Syntax enacts cognitive difference—paratactic simplicity + semantic gaps make reader work to construct meaning absent in narrator's consciousness.

## PASSAGE

[L1] Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, I could see them hitting. They
[L2] were coming toward where the flag was and I went along the fence. Luster was
[L3] hunting in the grass by the flower tree.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Stream of Consciousness** (streem uhv KON-shus-ness / striːm əv ˈkɒnʃəsnəs)
**Lines:** L1–3
**Definition:** Narrative technique presenting unfiltered flow of character's thoughts and perceptions in real time.
**Evidence:** Entire passage presents Benjy's immediate sensory experience without exposition, explanation, or temporal orientation.
**Effect:** Reader experiences cognitive difference from inside—we see only what Benjy sees, know only what he knows. No mediating narrator explains or interprets.
**Near-miss:** Not free indirect discourse (which maintains grammatical coherence while showing consciousness): stream-of-consciousness breaks rules Benjy doesn't understand.

### **Parataxis** (PAIR-uh-TAK-sis / ˌpærəˈtæksɪs)
**Lines:** L1–3
**Definition:** Coordination without subordination; clauses on flat logical plane.
**Evidence:** "I could see them hitting. They were coming... and I went... Luster was hunting"—facts accumulate without hierarchy.
**Effect:** No causal connections stated. One perception follows another without *because*, *although*, *while*. Reader experiences world as Benjy does: sequence without logic.
**Near-miss:** Not asyndeton (which omits connectors entirely): Faulkner uses minimal connectors ("and") but refuses subordinating conjunctions.

### **Concrete Diction** / **Hypotyposis** (hai-puh-tai-POH-sis / ˌhaɪpətaɪˈpoʊsɪs)
**Lines:** L1–3
**Definition:** Vivid description of scene using concrete, sensory detail.
**Evidence:** "fence," "flower spaces," "hitting," "flag," "grass," "flower tree"—all tactile, visible, nameable objects.
**Effect:** Benjy can only process what he directly perceives. No abstractions ("golf game," "Saturday," "searching"). Reader must supply concepts Benjy lacks.
**Near-miss:** Not ekphrasis (description of art object): this is perception without interpretation.

### **Catachresis** (KAT-uh-KREE-sis / ˌkætəˈkriːsɪs)
**Lines:** L1, L3
**Definition:** Strained metaphor; semantic misfit; wrong word for nameless thing.
**Evidence:** "flower spaces" (gaps between plantings—Benjy lacks "flower bed"); "flower tree" (flowering tree? tree near flowers? language fails).
**Effect:** Reader recognizes limitations in Benjy's lexicon. He creates compound nouns for things he can't properly name. The wrongness is the point.
**Near-miss:** Not neologism (invented word): Benjy uses real words wrongly combined.

### **Ellipsis** (ee-LIP-sis / ɪˈlɪpsɪs)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Omission of words necessary for grammatical completion.
**Evidence:** "them hitting"—antecedent of "them" missing; object of "hitting" missing; context assumed but not provided.
**Effect:** Reader must infer what Benjy cannot articulate. The gaps create interpretive work—we fill what he cannot.
**Near-miss:** Not brachylogia (legitimate grammatical compression): this is incompletion, not abbreviation.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee / məˈtɒnəmi)
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Substitution of associated term for thing meant.
**Evidence:** "where the flag was" = the golf hole. Benjy sees the flag, can't abstract to "hole" or "green."
**Effect:** Reader recognizes golf course (flag = golf), but Benjy doesn't. Dramatic irony: we know more than narrator.
**Near-miss:** Not synecdoche (part for whole): this is association, not part-whole relationship.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh / əˈnæfərə)
**Lines:** L1–2 (implicit)
**Definition:** Repeated opening structure.
**Evidence:** Implicit pronoun repetition: "I could see... I went..." Subject position anchored in "I."
**Effect:** Benjy's consciousness is centered—he reports what he perceives. Repetition creates accumulation without development.
**Risk:** Monotony. Here that's the point—Benjy's consciousness *is* monotonous, iterative, stuck.

### **Polysyndeton** (PAH-lee-SIN-duh-ton / ˌpɒlɪˈsɪndətɒn)
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Multiplication of conjunctions.
**Evidence:** "were coming... and I went... and [implied throughout]"—everything connected by "and."
**Effect:** Events blur into continuous present. No pause to rank or evaluate—just accumulation. Childlike run-on consciousness.
**Risk:** Can feel primitive if unmoored. Faulkner uses it precisely to signal cognitive limitation.

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh / ˈzuːɡmə)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Single word governing multiple elements in different senses.
**Evidence:** "through" and "between" both modify "I could see"—double prepositional layering creates spatial complexity.
**Effect:** Despite syntactic simplicity, spatial relationships are precise. Benjy understands *where*, even if he can't understand *why*.
**Risk:** Overuse can create confusion. Here it maps physical reality accurately.

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-ton / əˈsɪndətɒn)
**Lines:** L2–3 (sentence boundary)
**Definition:** Omission of conjunctions.
**Evidence:** "Luster was hunting" follows previous sentence with no connector. Abrupt subject shift.
**Effect:** Consciousness jumps. Reader experiences disjunction—who is Luster? Why now? Benjy notices things sequentially, can't smooth transitions.
**Risk:** Can feel choppy. Faulkner uses choppiness as characterization.

### **Symploce** (SIM-ploh-kee / ˈsɪmploʊki)
**Lines:** L1–2
**Definition:** Repetition of words at both beginning and end of successive clauses.
**Evidence:** "They were coming... and I went" / "where the flag was... where [implied locations]"—spatial and pronominal echoes.
**Effect:** Verbal patterns create cohesion despite lack of logical connection. Syntax holds consciousness together when meaning doesn't.
**Risk:** Overuse numbs. Faulkner's restraint makes each repetition count.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Preposed Locative Phrases**
**Lines:** L1
**Signals:**
- "Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces"—two prepositional phrases precede subject.
- Spatial orientation established before agent or action.
**Effect on stance:** Reader positioned in space before knowing who perceives. We see *through Benjy's eyes* literally—the fence is obstacle, the spaces are gaps. Syntax enacts embodied perception.
**Classical kin:** Hyperbaton (unusual word order), but this is functional: information structure (location → agent → action).

### **Modal Auxiliary + Perception Verb**
**Lines:** L1
**Signals:**
- "I could see"—modal "could" modifies sensory verb "see."
- Not "I saw" (direct) but "I could see" (conditional access).
**Effect on stance:** Perception is constrained, conditional. Benjy can see *through* and *between*—syntax emphasizes obstacles. Reader experiences limited access as grammatical fact.
**Classical kin:** Potential mood, but modality here is physical capability, not epistemic uncertainty.

### **Null Anaphora / Zero Deixis**
**Lines:** L1, L2
**Signals:**
- "them hitting"—no antecedent for "them." "Where the flag was"—no antecedent for "flag."
- Pronouns and definite articles assume shared knowledge reader lacks.
**Effect on stance:** Reader disoriented. We're mid-scene without exposition. Syntax assumes context Benjy assumes but can't articulate. We work to construct reference.
**Classical kin:** Anaphora (backward reference), but null anaphora is broken reference—no referent provided.

### **Participial Complements Without Objects**
**Lines:** L1
**Signals:**
- "them hitting"—present participle lacks object. Hitting *what*?
- Grammatically acceptable (object deletion in participles) but semantically insufficient.
**Effect on stance:** Action perceived but not understood. Benjy sees motion (hitting) without grasping game structure. Syntax mirrors cognitive gap.
**Classical kin:** Absolute construction (participial phrase), but incomplete—the incompletion is the point.

### **Aspect Layering (Simple Past + Past Progressive)**
**Lines:** L1–3
**Signals:**
- "could see," "went" (simple past) vs. "were coming," "was hunting" (past progressive).
- Mix of completed and ongoing action.
**Effect on stance:** Temporal thickness. Some actions feel finished (went), others ongoing (coming, hunting). Benjy experiences duration unevenly. Reader gets textured temporality despite simple syntax.
**Classical kin:** Imperfect vs. aorist (Greek), but English aspect distinction is viewpoint—Benjy's viewpoint shifts unconsciously.

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** L1 opens with fricatives: "Through...fence...flower...spaces"—soft, sliding sounds. Then plosives: "could...hitting...They"—harder consonants. L2–3 shift to liquids: "Luster...along...flower"—tongue-against-palate sounds. The mouth moves through textures like Benjy moves through space.

**Cadence seams:** Period after "hitting" is hard stop. "They" at L1–2 turn restarts motion. "And" at L2 is breath-valve—no pause, onward momentum. Period after "fence" breaks flow. Final period after "tree" suspends—more is coming.

**Alliteration:** "fence...flower...flower...flag" (f-cluster throughout); "Luster...along...grass...flower" (liquid l-sounds); "hunting...grass...tree" (no strong pattern, but guttural h, gr, tr).

**Assonance:** "through...flower" (oo/ow sounds); "hitting...coming...hunting" (-ing repetition); "was...grass" (short-a echo).

**Rhythm:** Unmetered prose, but patterns emerge:
- L1: "through the FENCE, be-TWEEN the CURL-ing FLOW-er SPAC-es"—trochaic tendency (STRESS-unstress).
- L2: "they were COM-ing to-WARD where the FLAG was"—iambic (unstress-STRESS).
- L3: "LUS-ter was HUNT-ing in the GRASS"—mix of trochaic and iambic.

**Music argues:** The ear hears simple, childlike rhythms. No complex cadences—just basic rise-fall patterns. The prosody matches the syntax: elementary, direct, unadorned.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:**
1. [Prep phrase] + [Prep phrase] + Subject + modal + verb + object + participle. (14 words)
2. Subject + verb + prep phrase + and + Subject + verb + prep phrase. (14 words)
3. Subject + verb + prep phrase + prep phrase. (9 words)

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Almost pure coordination. Only subordination: "where the flag was" (relative clause = spatial location, not logical relationship). Effect: flat consciousness—no hierarchy of importance, no causal chains.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** Locative phrases (L1) position observer before action.
- **Postposed:** Participial complement (L1 "hitting") trails verb. Prepositional phrases (L2–3) follow verbs.
- **Embedded:** Single relative clause (L2 "where the flag was")—only embedding is spatial.

**Inversion:** None. Strict SVO throughout (except L1's preposed prepositional phrases). Benjy's syntax is basic English word order.

**Information flow:** Location (through/between) → agent (I) → limited perception (could see) → ambiguous action (them hitting). Given: I, fence. New: them hitting, flag, Luster hunting. Flow is sensory-accumulative, not logical-progressive.

### Micro-rewrites:

**Compressed:** *"Through the fence I saw them hitting. They approached the flag and I followed. Luster hunted in the grass."*
**Lost:** "Between the curling flower spaces" (spatial precision), "could see" (modal limitation), "where the flag was" (Benjy's inability to name "hole"), "flower tree" (catachresis revealing naming deficit). Gained: false clarity—this sounds competent, losing Benjy's voice.

**Dilated:** *"As I looked through the fence, threading my gaze between the spaces separating the flower beds where flowers were planted in curling rows, I found that I was able to perceive them—those men—in the act of hitting golf balls with their clubs. They were approaching in my direction, moving toward the location where the flag marking the hole was positioned, and in response to their approach I proceeded to walk along the length of the fence. Meanwhile, my caretaker Luster was engaged in searching through the grass near the tree where flowers grew."*
**Lost:** Everything. Benjy's voice evaporates. This is competent adult narration—exactly what Faulkner refuses. The simplicity is the achievement.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** L1 "I" = here-now of perception. But "them" has no referent—broken deixis. "The fence," "the flag" assume shared knowledge reader lacks. L2–3 "Luster" introduced with definite article ("Luster," not "a man named Luster")—familiarity assumed. Deictic field is Benjy's, not reader's. We're disoriented by syntax that assumes context it doesn't provide.

**Aspect:**
- "could see" = simple past modal (potential perception in past frame)
- "hitting" = present participle (durative, unbounded action)
- "were coming" = past progressive (ongoing motion in past)
- "went" = simple past (completed motion)
- "was hunting" = past progressive (ongoing search)

Aspect alternates: progressive (durative) vs. simple (punctual). Benjy perceives some actions as ongoing, others as completed, without understanding temporal logic.

**Modality:**
- "could see" = dynamic modality (physical ability). Not "I saw" (direct) but "I could see" (capability enabled by positioning).
- No epistemic modals (no "might," "must," "should"). Benjy doesn't speculate, judge, or infer—only reports.
- No deontic modals (no "ought," "have to"). No sense of obligation or necessity.

**Quoted locus:** None. No reported speech, no internal dialogue. Only direct perception reported as fact. Effect: consciousness without reflection, observation without interpretation.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Barriers/Separation:** "fence" (physical boundary Benjy can't cross); "through," "between" (navigating obstacles).
2. **Vision/Limitation:** "could see" (constrained sight); "them" (unidentified figures); "flag" (visible sign of invisible game).
3. **Nature/Domestication:** "flower spaces," "grass," "flower tree"—cultivated nature, suburban landscape.

**Lexical fields:**
- **Spatial prepositions:** "through," "between," "toward," "along," "in," "by"—consciousness is all *location*.
- **Movement verbs:** "hitting," "coming," "went," "hunting"—all motion, no stasis.
- **Ambiguous reference:** "them," "they," "the flag," "the flower tree"—definite articles without antecedents.
- **Color/abstraction absence:** No colors named, no emotions, no evaluations. Pure phenomenology.

**Image logic in three sentences:** Benjy positioned at barrier (fence) observes incomprehensible activity (golf) through inadequate vocabulary (hitting, flag) while caretaker performs unspecified task (hunting—for what?). Every image is concrete but meaning is absent. Reader reconstructs (they're playing golf, Luster is looking for Benjy's lost ball) what Benjy cannot.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Strict first-person limited. Zero psychic distance—we have no access beyond what Benjy perceives. No narrator explains, contextualizes, or interprets. Internal focalization through radically limited consciousness. Reader gets pure phenomenology without cognition.

**Time (Genette):**
- **Order:** Linear in this excerpt, but novel's Benjy section time-shifts without markers. Here: sequential (see → come → go → hunt).
- **Duration:** Scene tempo—sentences track real-time observation (maybe 30 seconds elapsed).
- **Frequency:** Singulative (this moment told once), but Benjy's cognition collapses past and present elsewhere in novel. Time is always now for him.

**Beat structure:** Position (through/between) → perception (them hitting) → response (I went) → parallel observation (Luster hunting). Micro-rhythm: see, move, notice—basic consciousness algorithm.

**Subtext:** Everything is subtext for reader, nothing for Benjy. We infer: golf course, weekend, Compson property borders course, Luster tasked with watching Benjy, Luster looking for lost ball. Benjy reports; we interpret. The narrative engine is reader's hermeneutic labor.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Faulkner establishes narrative authority through radical commitment to limited perspective. No cheating, no explanatory intrusions. Reader trusts the constraint—this *is* how Benjy experiences world. Ethos built on refusal to help reader.

**Pathos:** Devastating through absence. Benjy doesn't self-pity, doesn't recognize his difference. Reader feels pathos *about* him, not *from* him. The gap between his simple reporting and our understanding of his marginalization creates emotional charge.

**Logos:** Anti-logos. No causality, no argument, no logic. Just sense data accumulation. The absence of logic is the rhetorical point—reader experiences cognitive difference as structural fact, not editorial claim.

**Lines:** No explicit appeals. The passage persuades through enactment—we believe in Benjy's consciousness because the syntax never breaks character.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Joyce's *Ulysses* (1922):** Stream-of-consciousness technique, shifting perspectives, syntactic differentiation by character. Faulkner radicalizes Joyce—where Molly Bloom's soliloquy shows consciousness intact, Benjy's shows consciousness broken.

**Gertrude Stein's *The Making of Americans* (1925):** Repetitive, simple syntax creating complex effects. Faulkner's parataxis echoes Stein's continuous present.

**Sherwood Anderson's *Winesburg, Ohio* (1919):** American modernist simplicity, Midwestern directness. Faulkner takes Anderson's plain style and makes it character-specific, not just aesthetic choice.

**Dostoyevsky's *The Idiot* (1869):** Prince Myshkin as holy fool, consciousness as moral lens. Faulkner inherits idea that intellectual disability can reveal rather than obscure truth.

**Subversion:** Faulkner proves syntax IS character. Previous disabled narrators were objects of observation. Benjy is subject—we're inside, not outside. The form makes this possible.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots:
1. **"them hitting"** (L1)—Two words, infinite interpretive demand. Who? Hitting what? The ambiguity is the novel's engine—reader must construct meaning narrator can't provide.
2. **"flower spaces"** (L1)—Catachresis revealing naming deficit. Benjy sees gaps, not beds. The wrongness exposes how language fails him.
3. **"where the flag was"** (L2)—Metonymy showing conceptual limitation. He sees flag, can't abstract to "golf hole." The substitution isn't rhetorical flourish—it's cognitive ceiling.

### Faultlines:
1. **"curling flower spaces"** (L1)—Adjective "curling" is sophisticated. **Risk:** Does Benjy know "curling"? **Defense:** He can perceive curved shapes, can have vocabulary without understanding. The risk is acceptable—modernist narration trusts productive ambiguity.
2. **"Luster was hunting"** (L3)—Sudden name without introduction. **Risk:** Confusing. **Defense:** Confusion is the point. Benjy knows Luster (his caretaker for years), assumes reader does. The gap is structural—we're always catching up.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

### Subtraction test:
**Remove:** Prepositional phrases "Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces"
**Result:** "I could see them hitting."
**Loss:** Spatial embodiment evaporates. We lose the physical obstacles, the navigating, the *through-ness* of vision. The sentence becomes simple observation instead of constrained perception. Those prepositions do enormous work—they position Benjy's body and limits in space.

### Amplification test:
**Heighten:** Subordination
**Result:** "Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, I could see them hitting golf balls, and because they were coming toward where the flag marked the ninth hole, I decided to walk along the fence so I could keep watching, while Luster, who was supposed to be watching me, was hunting in the grass by the dogwood tree for the golf ball I had found earlier."
**Gain:** Full exposition. **Loss:** Everything. Benjy disappears. This is competent adult narrator. Faulkner's genius is in what he withholds.

### Register shift (formal ↔ colloquial):
**Formal:** "From my vantage point beyond the fence, between the cultivated flower beds, I observed the golfers striking their balls. They approached the flag marking the hole, and I proceeded along the fence line. My attendant Luster was searching the grass near the flowering tree."
**Effect:** Becomes third-person, educated, clinical. Loses first-person immediacy and cognitive limitation. This could be sociology, not consciousness.

**Colloquial:** "Through the fence, between the flowers, I saw them hitting. They came to the flag and I walked by the fence. Luster looked in the grass by the tree."
**Effect:** Closer to original, but "saw" (not "could see") and "looked" (not "was hunting") add competence. Even small changes toward clarity undo Benjy's voice.

### Punctuation swap:
**Period → Dash:** "Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, I could see them hitting—they were coming toward where the flag was—and I went along the fence—Luster was hunting in the grass by the flower tree."
**Effect:** Stream-of-consciousness intensifies. Dash-chains suggest rushed, breathless observation. Faulkner's periods are crucial—they create pauses Benjy's consciousness needs. The simplicity requires traditional punctuation.

### Focalization nudge:
**Current:** First-person internal (Benjy's POV).
**Shift to third-person:** "Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, Benjy could see them hitting. They were coming toward where the flag was and he went along the fence. Luster was hunting in the grass by the flower tree."
**Effect:** Becomes observation *of* Benjy, not experience *as* Benjy. Third-person creates distance, allows evaluation. First-person is essential—no distance, just immersion.

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

### Imitatio (new content, same scaffolding):
*Through the window, between the waving curtain edges, I could see them dancing. They were moving toward where the music was and I stayed by the glass. Mother was talking in the room with the lamp.*

**Replicates:** Preposed locatives, "could see" modal limitation, "them" + participle without object, ambiguous reference ("the music"—what music? where?), paratactic accumulation, abrupt subject shift, spatial grounding.

### Counter-Imitatio (same content, opposing scaffolding):
*As I positioned myself at the fence, looking through the gaps between the flower beds, I observed several golfers hitting their balls toward the ninth hole, marked by a flag. I decided to follow them by walking along the fence line. My caretaker, Luster, was meanwhile searching in the grass near a nearby tree, looking for something.*

**Opposes:** Eliminates preposed locatives (embeds subordinate clauses instead), removes "could see" limitation (uses "observed"), provides full context ("golfers," "ninth hole"), explicates motivation ("decided," "looking for something"), uses subordination ("As," "looking"), removes catachresis ("flower beds" not "flower spaces"). Swaps cognitive limitation for competent narration.

### Compression (≤15 words):
*Through the fence I saw them hitting. They came; I followed. Luster hunted by the tree.*

**Keeps:** Core spatial positioning, ambiguous reference, parataxis, motion verbs. Cuts: "between the curling flower spaces," "could see," "where the flag was," "in the grass"—all spatial precision that makes Benjy's embodiment real.

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. **Constrain syntax to character's cognitive limits; never break frame.** (No cheating—if Benjy can't think it, don't write it)
2. **Use preposed locatives to position embodied perception before action.** (Where I am determines what I can see)
3. **Deploy ambiguous reference to create interpretive labor for reader.** ("them," "the flag"—reader works to construct context)
4. **Employ catachresis (wrong compounds) to show naming deficits.** ("flower spaces," "flower tree"—reveals vocabulary limitations)
5. **Maintain parataxis to eliminate causal reasoning.** (No "because"—just and, and, and)
6. **Use modal "could" with perception verbs to show constrained access.** (Not "I saw" but "I could see"—ability is limited)
7. **Shift subjects abruptly to mimic consciousness that can't smooth transitions.** (Jump from "I" to "Luster" without explanation)
