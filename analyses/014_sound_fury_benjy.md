## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Stream of Consciousness** (streem ov KON-shus-ness)
*Definition:* Narrative mode presenting continuous flow of character's thoughts.
*Example:* The entire passage—presenting Benjy's limited, present-tense consciousness.
*Effect:* Creates immediacy; reveals cognitive disability through syntax and diction.

### **Parataxis** (pair-uh-TAK-sis)
*Definition:* Coordination without subordination.
*Example:* Simple sentences or clauses connected with "and."
*Effect:* Mimics simple, concrete thought process of mentally disabled narrator.

### **Concrete Diction** (kon-KREET DIK-shun)
*Definition:* Use of specific, tangible language rather than abstract.
*Example:* "fence," "flower spaces," "hitting," "grass"—all physical, visible things.
*Effect:* Reveals Benjy's inability to abstract; he can only report what he senses directly.

### **Ambiguity** (am-bih-GYOO-ih-tee)
*Definition:* Unclear or uncertain meaning.
*Example:* "them hitting"—who are "they"? What are they hitting?
*Effect:* Places reader in Benjy's confused perspective; we must work to understand.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Substitution of associated term for thing meant.
*Example:* "where the flag was" for "the golf hole"
*Effect:* Benjy can't name or understand the golf game, so describes its visible parts.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Prepositional Phrases
"Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces"—the sentence begins with **two prepositional phrases of location** before we reach the subject. This syntactic delay is crucial: we are positioned in space before we know who is positioned or what they perceive.

The phrases are concrete and specific:
- "Through the fence" (barrier, separation)
- "between the curling flower spaces" (navigating between planted areas)

The unusual phrase **"flower spaces"** is syntactically simple (noun + noun) but semantically odd. Most speakers would say "flower beds" or "flowers," but Benjy identifies the spaces between them. This syntactic simplicity revealing conceptual difference is key to Faulkner's technique.

### Sensory Verb
"I could see"—the **modal auxiliary "could"** with perception verb establishes limited, conditional access. Benjy doesn't just "see"—he "could see" (through the fence, between the spaces). The syntax emphasizes the obstacles to perception, the conditional nature of understanding.

### Ambiguous Object
"them hitting"—this is **syntactically incomplete**. The object "them" has unclear antecedent (who are they?), and "hitting" is a **present participle** without object (hitting what?). Standard English would require more information, but Benjy's syntax doesn't provide it.

The **gerund phrase "them hitting"** as direct object is grammatically acceptable but semantically insufficient. We need more information than the syntax provides. This is intentional—Faulkner uses syntactic simplicity to create semantic complexity.

### Simple Coordination
"They were coming toward where the flag was and I went along the fence"—two **independent clauses** joined by simple coordination. The syntax is what Tufte calls **pure parataxis**: Clause + "and" + Clause, with no subordination, no hierarchy, no causal connection specified.

The syntax suggests these events are simultaneous or sequential, but doesn't specify relationship beyond temporal contiguity. This is how Benjy experiences time: one thing, then another, then another, without clear causation.

### Locative Constructions
"toward where the flag was"—this is a complex **prepositional phrase** using a relative clause ("where the flag was") as the object of "toward." The syntax shows Benjy can handle embedded structures, but notice what he embeds: spatial relationships, not abstract concepts.

The verb "was" (past tense) is technically inconsistent with "were coming" (past progressive), but this is Benjy's syntax—it doesn't maintain perfect temporal coherence.

### Parallel Clauses
"I could see them hitting. They were coming... and I went..."—the syntax creates **parallel structure**:
- I [verb] them [verb]ing
- They were [verb]ing... and I [verb]ed

This parallelism through repeated subject-verb patterns creates rhythm while maintaining simplicity. The syntax never gets complex; it remains in the basic subject-verb-object or subject-verb-modifier pattern.

### Absence of Subordination
Crucially, the passage contains **almost no subordination**. There are no "because," "although," "while," "if" constructions. Everything is coordinate or paratactic. This syntactic choice reveals Benjy's cognitive limitation: he can't subordinate ideas, can't create hierarchies of causation or condition.

The only subordination is spatial ("where the flag was"), not logical or causal. Benjy can embed location but not reason.

### Simple Past Tense
"I went along the fence"—the **simple past tense** maintains the temporal frame. The verb "went" is the simplest motion verb, and the prepositional phrase "along the fence" describes the path concretely.

Notice Benjy doesn't explain why he went along the fence—the syntax presents action without motivation, effect without cause.

### New Subject Introduction
"Luster was hunting in the grass"—a new sentence introduces a **new subject** without transition or explanation. Who is Luster? Why is he relevant? The syntax doesn't tell us. We simply shift from "I" to "Luster" without syntactic connection.

This **abrupt subject shift** without transitional syntax is characteristic of Benjy's narration. His consciousness notices things sequentially but doesn't connect them logically.

### Progressive Aspect
"was hunting"—the **past progressive** suggests ongoing action observed at a point in time. Benjy perceives the action in progress. The syntax emphasizes the durational quality of Luster's action.

### Specific Location
"in the grass by the flower tree"—the **prepositional phrases** stack spatial information:
- "in the grass" (immediate location)
- "by the flower tree" (landmark/reference point)

The phrase **"flower tree"** is syntactically simple but semantically unclear. Is it a flowering tree? A tree near flowers? Benjy's syntax creates these simple noun compounds that don't fully clarify meaning.

### Sentence Structure Analysis
All sentences follow basic patterns:
1. [Prep phrases] + I + could see + [object] + [participle] (7 words)
2. They + were coming + [prep phrase] + and + I + went + [prep phrase] (14 words)
3. Luster + was hunting + [prep phrases] (8 words)

The **syntactic templates** are elementary: Subject + Verb + Location/Object. This is what linguists call **basic word order** with minimal embedding. Yet within this simplicity, Faulkner achieves extraordinary effects.

### What the Syntax Omits
Notice what's absent:
- No abstract nouns (no "game," "sport," "day")
- No psychological verbs (no "thought," "felt," "wanted")
- No complex temporal markers (no "before," "after," "since")
- No causal conjunctions (no "because," "so that")
- No conditional constructions (no "if...then")
- No relative clauses except for location
- No passive voice
- No perfect aspects

These absences are as meaningful as what's present. The syntax defines Benjy's consciousness through exclusion.

### Present-ness of Experience
Though told in past tense, the syntax creates **immediacy**. The simple past and past progressive ("could see," "were coming," "was hunting") combined with concrete diction make everything feel present, observed. Benjy doesn't reflect on past experience; he presents it as if happening now.

### Repetition of Structures
The **syntactic repetition** (subject-verb-location, subject-verb-action) creates what Tufte calls **cumulative rhythm through parallel simplicity**. We're not getting varied complex sentences but repeated simple ones, which creates both monotony and hypnotic quality—appropriate for Benjy's consciousness.

### Stylistic Effect
Through radically simplified syntax—parataxis, simple tenses, concrete diction, minimal subordination—Faulkner creates one of the most innovative narrative voices in American literature. The syntax doesn't describe Benjy's mental disability; it **enacts** it. We don't observe Benjy's consciousness from outside; we experience it from inside through the syntax itself.

This is Tufte's principle at its most radical: syntax as character, syntax as consciousness, syntax as meaning. The simple, coordinate, concrete structures don't just convey Benjy's limited understanding—they ARE that understanding. Faulkner proves that syntactic simplicity can achieve extraordinary complexity of effect. By stripping syntax to its most basic elements and rigorously maintaining those constraints, he creates prose that places readers inside a radically different consciousness. The form IS the content, and both are unforgettable.
