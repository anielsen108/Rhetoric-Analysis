# Passage 020: Things Fall Apart Opening

**Chinua Achebe** · *Things Fall Apart* · 1958 | Chapter 1

**Occasion/Pressure:** Novel's threshold; must establish Igbo culture as norm (not exotic), introduce protagonist through cultural values, counter colonial narratives.
**Persona/Stance:** Third-person omniscient with oral storytelling cadence; voice embeds African epistemology in English syntax.
**Thesis of Effect:** The syntax performs cultural respect—precise numbers, unitalicized names, matter-of-fact epithets create grammatical parity between African and European narrative traditions.

## PASSAGE

[L1] Okonkwo was well known throughout the nine villages and even beyond. His fame
[L2] rested on solid personal achievements. As a young man of eighteen he had brought
[L3] honor to his village by throwing Amalinze the Cat. Amalinze was the great wrestler
[L4] who for seven years was unbeaten, from Umuofia to Mbaino.

---

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Epithet** (EP-ih-thet / ˈɛpɪˌθɛt)
**Lines:** L3
**Definition:** Descriptive phrase/title characterizing a person.
**Evidence:** "Amalinze the Cat"—wrestler known by honorific title, no explanation offered.
**Effect:** Creates oral storytelling quality; suggests reputation-based society where names carry achievement. Reader enters culture where epithets are natural, not exotic.
**Near-miss:** Not nickname (casual): epithet is formal, earned through public recognition.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee / haɪˈpɜːrbəli)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Deliberate exaggeration for emphasis.
**Evidence:** "throughout the nine villages and even beyond"—fame extending infinitely outward.
**Effect:** Establishes Okonkwo's exceptional status; creates legendary register appropriate for epic opening. Reader understands: this is *important* man.
**Near-miss:** Not mere statement of fact: "even beyond" pushes past literal into mythic.

### **Litotes** (LAI-toh-teez / ˈlaɪtoʊtiːz; alt. LIT-uh-teez / ˈlɪtətiːz)
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Understatement via restrained language.
**Evidence:** "solid personal achievements"—understated phrase for defeating legendary unbeaten wrestler.
**Effect:** Creates measured, respectful tone; suggests cultural value on modesty and communal restraint. Not boastful, not excessive—dignified.
**Near-miss:** Not meiosis (simple understatement): litotes implies more than stated.

### **Specificity / Enargeia** (en-AR-gay-uh / ɛnˈɑːrɡeɪə)
**Lines:** L2, L4
**Definition:** Vivid detailing through precise particulars.
**Evidence:** "eighteen" (exact age), "seven years" (precise duration), "nine villages" (specific number).
**Effect:** Creates authenticity through documentary precision; grounds legendary story in historical reality. Reader trusts the narrative through accumulation of exact details.
**Near-miss:** Not vagueness: Achebe refuses "many villages" or "years"—gives actual numbers.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh / əˈnæfərə)
**Lines:** L3-4
**Definition:** Repetition at beginning of clauses.
**Evidence:** "Amalinze...Amalinze the great wrestler..."—name repeated at sentence openings.
**Effect:** Creates emphasis through repetition; builds legendary status. Reader hears oral storytelling rhythm—the defeated opponent gets full naming, full honor.
**Near-miss:** Not polyptoton (varying forms): same name, exact repetition.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Parataxis** (PAIR-uh-TAK-sis / ˌpærəˈtæksɪs)
**Lines:** L1-4
**Definition:** Coordination without subordination; flat logical plane.
**Evidence:** Four independent declarative sentences: was known. rested. had brought. was unbeaten. No because/although/while.
**Effect:** Creates oral narrative flow; facts accumulate without overt logical connectors. Reader supplies causal links—active participation in meaning-making.
**Risk:** Could feel choppy. Achebe balances with internal complexity (subordinate clauses within sentences).

### **Amplificatio** (am-plih-fih-KAH-tee-oh / ˌæmplɪfɪˈkeɪʃioʊ)
**Lines:** L3-4
**Definition:** Expansion through accumulating details.
**Evidence:** Okonkwo's achievement gets more specific: threw wrestler → who was "the Cat" → who was unbeaten seven years → across specific geography.
**Effect:** Each addition builds significance. Reader experiences expanding revelation of achievement's magnitude.
**Risk:** Over-explanation can deflate. Achebe stops at perfect point—no more detail needed.

### **Isocolon** (eye-SOH-kuh-lon / aɪˈsɒkəˌlɒn)
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Successive clauses of similar length/structure.
**Evidence:** "His fame rested on solid personal achievements." (7 words) / "As a young man of eighteen" (6 words)—balanced rhythm.
**Effect:** Creates measured, formal cadence; suggests narrative control and authority. Reader feels stability, reliability of narrator.
**Risk:** Too much balance can feel artificial. Achebe varies after establishing pattern.

### **Polyptoton** (pol-ip-TOH-ton / ˌpɒlɪpˈtoʊtɒn)
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Repetition of words from same root.
**Evidence:** Implicit—"known" (L1) relates to knowledge/recognition; "fame" (L2) relates to being known. Semantic family.
**Effect:** Reinforces central concept (reputation) through lexical cohesion. Reader tracks thematic consistency.
**Risk:** Can feel repetitive if too obvious. Here it's subtle, effective.

### **Diacope** (die-AK-oh-pee / daɪˈækəpi)
**Lines:** L3-4
**Definition:** Repetition of word/phrase with intervening material.
**Evidence:** "Amalinze" (L3) ...intervening description... "Amalinze" (L3-4)—name repeated with elaboration between.
**Effect:** Creates emphasis through repetition; allows for definition/expansion between instances. Reader gets progressive revelation.
**Risk:** Can feel redundant. Here it honors the defeated opponent—worth full naming.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Passive Voice as Cultural Grammar**
**Lines:** L1, L4
**Signals:**
- "was well known" (passive)—emphasizes state of being known, not who knows him.
- "was unbeaten" (passive)—emphasizes invincibility, not who failed to beat him.
**Effect on stance:** Fame is objective fact, not dependent on observers. Reputation exists as social reality, not individual opinions. Reader accepts Okonkwo's status as given.
**Classical kin:** Passive periphrasis, but modern function: voice choice reveals epistemology (how culture understands knowledge/reputation).

### **Definite Article as Insider Knowledge**
**Lines:** L1, L3, L4
**Signals:**
- "the nine villages" (not "nine villages")—THE signals known entity.
- "the Cat" (epithet treated as proper noun)
- "the great wrestler" (THE = superlative status)
**Effect on time/authority:** Syntax assumes reader shares cultural knowledge. No explanation of what "nine villages" are—they exist as fact. Reader enters world where African geography is naturalized.
**Classical kin:** Definite article in Greek/Latin for cultural touchstones. Modern function: resists colonial exoticization.

### **Prepositional Phrase Accumulation (Spatial Extension)**
**Lines:** L1, L4
**Signals:**
- "throughout the nine villages and even beyond"—spatial phrases expand outward.
- "from Umuofia to Mbaino"—endpoints define range.
**Effect on stance:** Syntax performs geographical specificity. These aren't generic African villages but specific places with specific names. Reader maps cultural terrain through grammar.
**Classical kin:** Amplification through place. Modern: syntax naturalizes African place names without translation/italics.

### **Past Perfect as Temporal Layering**
**Lines:** L2-3
**Signals:**
- "he had brought honor"—past perfect tense (completed action before simple past).
- Creates two time layers: present fame (was known) ← past achievement (had brought).
**Effect on time/authority:** Syntax creates historical depth. Present status has clear causal origin in past action. Reader understands: this is not arbitrary fame but earned reputation with traceable history.
**Classical kin:** Pluperfect for antecedent action. Modern: tense as narrative architecture—building present on past.

### **Subordinate Temporal Clause + Main Clause Architecture**
**Lines:** L2-3
**Signals:**
- "As a young man of eighteen [subordinate temporal] + he had brought honor [main clause]"
- Sentence structure: time-frame first, action second.
**Effect on stance:** Syntax establishes when before what—creates narrative expectation, then delivers. Reader gets context (his age) before achievement (the victory).
**Classical kin:** Hypotaxis (subordination). Modern: information structure—old info (time) before new (action).

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** L1 opens with plosives and nasals: "Okonkwo was well known"—hard K, double N creates percussion. L3 shifts to sibilants: "seven...was...from"—softer, sustained. The mouth alternates between sharp consonants (Okonkwo, Cat, Amalinze) and flowing vowels (throughout, honor, village).

**Cadence seams:** Period after "beyond" is full stop—establishes fame. Period after "achievements" is shorter sentence—breath, then explanation. Period after "Cat" is name-completion. Period after "Mbaino" closes geographic frame.

**Alliteration:** "well...nine villages" (no w in villages, but near); "fame...personal" (f/p labial cluster); "Amalinze...Amalinze" (exact repetition); "seven...was...from" (s-cluster).

**Assonance:** "known...Okonkwo" (oh-sounds); "fame...great...Amalinze" (long-a sounds); "unbeaten...Umuofia" (oo-sounds).

**Rhythm:** L1: "o-KON-kwo WAS well KNOWN through-OUT the NINE vil-LAGES and E-ven be-YOND" (mixed iambic/trochaic—conversational, not poetic). L2-3: "his FAME REST-ed ON so-LID per-SON-al a-CHIEVE-ments" (falling rhythm, declarative). L3-4: "A-ma-LIN-ze WAS the GREAT WRES-tler WHO for SEV-en YEARS was un-BEA-ten" (ceremonial, building).

**Music argues:** The ear hears authoritative prose—measured, specific, building. Not lyrical poetry but oral history. The rhythm says: these are facts worth recording, not artistic embellishment.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:**
1. Simple declarative with compound prepositional phrases: Subject-copula-predicate + location/extent phrases.
2. Simple declarative with prepositional phrase: Subject-verb-preposition phrase (foundation metaphor).
3. Complex sentence: Subordinate temporal + main clause + prepositional phrase (instrumental).
4. Complex sentence: Main clause + relative clause + temporal phrase + spatial phrase.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Primarily paratactic (4 independent sentences) with internal hypotaxis (subordinate clauses within sentences 3-4). Effect: oral storytelling clarity—one fact, then another, but each fact has internal complexity.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Adverbial:** "well known" (degree), "even beyond" (extent)—postposed for expansion.
- **Adjectival:** "solid personal" (both modifying achievements), "young man of eighteen" (age specification), "great wrestler" (status).
- **Prepositional:** "throughout," "on," "to his village," "by throwing," "from...to"—Achebe uses prepositions to create precise spatial and causal relationships.

**Inversion:** None. Strict SVO throughout. Subject always initial position—creates stability, authority, narrative control.

**Information flow:** Given (Okonkwo introduced by name) → new (his fame). Given (fame mentioned) → new (its source). Given (his youth) → new (his action). Given (Amalinze named) → new (his status). Pattern: foundation, then elaboration.

### Micro-rewrites:

**Compressed:** *"Okonkwo was famous regionally for defeating legendary wrestler Amalinze the Cat at eighteen."*
**Lost:** Oral rhythm, specific numbers (nine villages, seven years), geographic names, separate sentence honoring Amalinze, "solid personal" dignity, spatial extension "even beyond." Gained: economy, directness—but loses cultural richness.

**Dilated:** *"Okonkwo had achieved considerable renown and widespread recognition not only throughout the confederation of nine villages that comprised the local political unit but also in the more distant territories beyond. This reputation and high social standing were not based on inherited status or family connections but rather on concrete individual accomplishments that he himself had achieved through his own efforts. At the relatively young age of eighteen years, he had succeeded in bringing considerable honor and prestige to his community by defeating in wrestling competition a man known as Amalinze the Cat, who was regarded as the greatest wrestler in the region and who, remarkably, had maintained an undefeated record for a period spanning seven full years, competing in matches across the territory from Umuofia to Mbaino."*
**Lost:** Oral economy, natural rhythm, dignity of restraint, power of understatement, cultural confidence (no need to explain everything). Gained: Victorian verbosity, colonial over-explanation (treating reader as outsider), pedantic exhaustion.

**Focalization shift (full oral performance):** *"You want to hear about Okonkwo? Ah! That man was known everywhere—nine villages, yes, even past them! You know why? His own hands, his own strength. When he was just eighteen—imagine, eighteen!—he threw Amalinze. You know Amalinze the Cat? The one nobody beat for seven years? From Umuofia all the way to Mbaino? That Amalinze. Okonkwo threw him!"*
**Effect:** Full oral register. Gains dramatic immediacy, audience interaction. Loses literary dignity, written authority. Achebe balances oral rhythms WITH written form—best of both.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Simple past throughout ("was," "rested," "had brought," "was")—narrator looks back from unspecified present. But narrative voice feels immediate, not distant. Tense is past; tone is present.

**Aspect:**
- "was known" = stative (ongoing state of reputation)
- "rested" = stative (fame's foundation exists)
- "had brought" = perfective (completed action anterior to main past)
- "throwing" = gerund/participial (naming the action)
- "was" = stative (Amalinze's status)
- "was unbeaten" = stative passive (maintained condition over time)

**Modality:**
- No modal auxiliaries (would, could, might)—everything presented as fact, not speculation.
- Epistemic stance: absolute certainty. Narrator knows these facts; reader should accept them.
- Evidential basis: unstated but implied—this is oral tradition, communal knowledge.

**Quoted locus:** No direct speech. All narrative summary—oratio obliqua without quotation. Creates narrative authority: this is what happened, not what someone claims happened.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Architecture/Foundation:** "rested on solid" (fame as building on foundation)—stability, construction, permanence.
2. **Geography/Spatial:** "throughout," "beyond," "from...to"—mapping cultural terrain.
3. **Competition/Honor:** "throwing" (wrestling term), "unbeaten" (martial status)—culture values combat excellence.

**Lexical fields:**
- **Reputation cluster:** "known," "fame," "honor," "great"—vocabulary of social standing.
- **Precision markers:** "eighteen," "seven years," "nine villages"—numbers create documentary effect.
- **Cultural titles:** "the Cat," proper nouns (Okonkwo, Amalinze, Umuofia, Mbaino)—names establish reality.

**Image logic:** Fame = building with foundation (metaphor). Foundation = personal achievement (literal). Achievement = wrestling victory (specific). Victory = defeating legendary champion (historical). The passage moves from abstract (fame) to concrete (specific match), building credibility through increasing particularity.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Third-person omniscient, but focalized through communal knowledge (not individual consciousness). Psychic distance: external—we see Okonkwo from outside, through reputation, not through interiority. Effect: character introduced as social being, not psychological subject.

**Time (Genette):**
- **Order:** Analeptic (flashback). Present fame explained by past achievement. L1-2 = later time (fame exists); L3-4 = earlier time (how fame originated).
- **Duration:** Summary. Wrestling match itself compressed to one phrase ("by throwing"). Amalinze's seven-year record summarized in clause. Story-time = years; discourse-time = four sentences.
- **Frequency:** Singulative (one event told once). The match happened once; told once. But implies iterative (fame continues; "was known" = ongoing).

**Beat structure:** Claim (L1: he was famous) → foundation (L2: based on achievements) → evidence (L3: specific victory) → significance (L4: opponent's status). Classical rhetorical structure: assertion, reason, proof, amplification.

**Subtext:** Why specify "solid personal achievements"? Implies some people have hollow fame (inherited, not earned). Why detail Amalinze's record? To prove Okonkwo's victory wasn't luck but defeating genuine champion. Subtext: this culture values *earned* status over *ascribed* status—central to novel's theme (Okonkwo's anxiety about his father's failure).

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Narrator establishes authority through:
- Precise numbers (not vague generalities)
- Specific names (Umuofia, Mbaino—real-sounding geography)
- Measured tone (not boastful or defensive)
- Cultural confidence (no apology, no explanation for epithets or customs)
Reader trusts narrator who treats African culture as norm, not exotic object.

**Pathos:** Understated emotion. "solid personal achievements" carries pride without bragging. "brought honor to his village" emphasizes communal benefit over individual glory—reader feels cultural values (individual serves community). "unbeaten...seven years" builds sympathy for Amalinze, making Okonkwo's victory more impressive.

**Logos:** Logical structure: Fame exists → fame has cause → cause is specific achievement → achievement is extraordinary (defeated unbeaten champion). Syllogistic clarity. Reader follows reasoning: if A defeated B, and B was unbeatable, then A must be exceptional.

**Cultural argument:** The deeper logos is political/cultural: African society has order, history, value systems worthy of epic narrative. Syntax that treats Igbo names without translation, that uses specific numbers, that honors defeated opponent—all argue: this culture deserves same narrative respect as Greek/Roman/European cultures. The form IS the argument.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Homer's epithet system:** "Amalinze the Cat" functions like "swift-footed Achilles" or "ox-eyed Hera." Achebe uses Homeric oral technique for African content—asserts cultural parity through form.

**Oral epic tradition:** Opening "in medias res" (Okonkwo already famous); use of specific numbers (nine villages, seven years—mnemonic devices); epithets; geographic catalogues (Umuofia to Mbaino). Universal oral storytelling techniques applied to African material.

**19th-century realism:** Specific dates, precise numbers, documentary detail (Austen, Balzac, Eliot). Achebe uses realist conventions to authenticate African story—refusing "timeless tribal past," insisting on historical specificity.

**Hemingway's declarative syntax:** Short sentences, parataxis, concrete nouns, minimal adjectives. Achebe's "was well known" echoes Hemingway's "was good." Both use simple syntax for weighty content—understatement as power.

**Subversion:** Achebe takes Western forms (novel, English language, realist detail) and fills them with African content *without translation, without apology, without exoticization*. Revolutionary form: African names in roman type (not italics), African customs presented as normal (not explained as exotic), African geography mapped precisely (not vague "the bush").

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots:
1. **"solid personal achievements"** (L2)—Three-word phrase carries novel's central theme. "Personal" means earned, not inherited (Okonkwo's anxiety about father). "Achievements" plural—not one lucky victory but multiple accomplishments. "Solid" = unshakeable, real, substantial. Entire novel's conflict in one noun phrase.

2. **"the nine villages"** (L1)—Definite article + specific number. Reader either knows what these are (insider) or accepts them as given (outsider respecting insider knowledge). No explanation, no footnote, no apology. The syntax performs decolonization.

3. **"Amalinze the Cat"** (L3)—Epithet in English syntax, African naming convention, no italics, no translation. Three words demonstrate Achebe's revolutionary technique: African content in English form, treated as linguistically normal.

### Faultlines:
1. **"throwing"** (L3)—Single gerund for entire wrestling match. **Risk:** Understates the drama—we don't see the match, just its result. **Defense:** This is how oral summary works—outcome matters more than blow-by-blow. Also, understatement creates dignity (not sensationalized sports narrative).

2. **"well known"** (L1)—Passive construction. **Risk:** Could feel weak or vague. Whose perspective is "known"? **Defense:** That's exactly the point—fame is communal judgment, not individual opinion. Passive voice embeds epistemology: reputation is social fact.

3. **"even beyond"** (L1)—Vague after all the specificity. **Risk:** Hyperbolic and imprecise after "nine villages." **Defense:** Captures oral storytelling's tendency toward expansion—fame extends infinitely in the telling. The vagueness after precision creates sense of legendary status.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

### Subtraction test:
**Remove:** "personal" from "solid personal achievements"
**Result:** "His fame rested on solid achievements."
**Loss:** Crucial thematic distinction between earned and inherited status evaporates. Without "personal," we don't know if achievements are his own or family's. Novel's central conflict depends on that one adjective.

### Amplification test:
**Heighten:** Add psychological interiority
**Result:** "Okonkwo felt pride knowing he was famous throughout the nine villages and even beyond. He believed his fame rested on what he himself had accomplished, not on his father's reputation."
**Gain:** Emotional access, psychological depth. **Risk:** Destroys Achebe's strategy of external focalization. Opening establishes Okonkwo through social reputation, not internal consciousness. The interiority comes later—structural choice.

### Register shift (formal ↔ colloquial):
**Formal:** "Okonkwo had acquired considerable renown throughout the confederation of nine villages and in territories beyond. His reputation was predicated upon substantial individual accomplishments. At the age of eighteen years, he had conferred honor upon his community by defeating in wrestling competition..."
**Effect:** Victorian colonial prose. Loses oral rhythm, cultural confidence, narrative economy. Sounds like anthropologist's report, not story.

**Colloquial:** "Everybody knew Okonkwo. The guy was famous all over the place. He'd earned it fair and square. When he was just eighteen, he beat Amalinze the Cat. Now that dude was something—nobody could touch him for seven years..."
**Effect:** American informal. Gains accessibility; loses cultural dignity, oral epic register, precision. Wrong code-switching.

### Punctuation swap:
**Period → Semicolon:** "Okonkwo was well known throughout the nine villages and even beyond; his fame rested on solid personal achievements; as a young man of eighteen he had brought honor..."
**Effect:** Creates compound-complex sentence instead of discrete sentences. More Faulknerian, less oral. Loses the declarative rhythm of oral storytelling—one statement, breath, next statement.

### Focalization nudge:
**Current:** External omniscient (social reputation)
**Shift to internal:** "Okonkwo knew they spoke his name in all nine villages and beyond. He felt his fame resting on what he himself had achieved. He remembered: at eighteen, he had brought honor..."
**Effect:** Psychological focalization. Gains interiority; loses communal perspective. Achebe's choice—introduce through reputation, then later access consciousness—is structural strategy, not limitation.

### Tense shift:
**Past → Present:** "Okonkwo is well known throughout the nine villages and even beyond. His fame rests on solid personal achievements..."
**Effect:** Historical present creates immediacy. But Achebe's past tense is crucial—this is completed action (the wrestling match), ongoing state (the fame), and it's being narrated from stable retrospective position. Not journalistic present-tense but authoritative past.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

### Imitatio (new content, same scaffolding):
*Obierika was well respected throughout the four clans and even beyond. His wisdom rested on careful measured judgments. As a middle-aged man of thirty-five he had prevented war between villages by negotiating fair compensation. The dispute was the bitter land quarrel that for two seasons had threatened violence, from Iguedo to Umuike.*

**Replicates:** External focalization, passive "was respected," specific number (four clans), "even beyond" expansion, metaphoric predicate (wisdom "rested"), specific age, village benefit emphasized, epithet-like description (bitter land quarrel), specific duration (two seasons), geographic endpoints.

### Counter-Imitatio (same content, opposing scaffolding):
*I'm going to tell you about this guy Okonkwo, who was pretty much the most famous person around here. Why was he famous? Because unlike a lot of people who just inherit their status from their parents, Okonkwo actually did stuff to earn his reputation. The coolest thing he ever did—and this is what really put him on the map—was when he was barely out of his teens, like maybe eighteen years old, he went up against this legendary wrestler everyone called "the Cat," whose real name was Amalinze, and who nobody—and I mean nobody—had been able to beat in something like seven years, no matter where you went from Umuofia all the way to Mbaino...*

**Opposes:** First person narrator (I'll tell you), informal register (pretty much, coolest, barely out of his teens), explanatory asides (unlike people who inherit), psychological speculation (what put him on the map), colloquial syntax (run-on with dashes), ironic quotation marks ("the Cat"), rhetorical emphasis (nobody—and I mean nobody). Swaps dignified oral tradition for chatty informality.

### Compression (≤25 words):
*Okonkwo was famous throughout the nine villages for personal achievements. At eighteen, he threw Amalinze the Cat, unbeaten wrestler for seven years.*

**Keeps:** Names, numbers, passive fame, key epithet. Cuts: "even beyond," "solid," "honor to village," geographic names, separate sentence for Amalinze's status. Loses cultural dignity through compression.

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. **Use specific numbers, not vague quantifiers.** ("nine villages," "eighteen," "seven years"—not "many villages," "young," "years")
2. **Employ epithets without explanation—treat them as normal.** ("Amalinze the Cat"—no quotes, no aside, no translation)
3. **Use definite articles to assume insider knowledge.** ("the nine villages," "the Cat"—THE signals: you should know this)
4. **Balance passive and active constructions.** ("was known" / "brought honor"—state and agency both matter)
5. **Deploy parataxis for oral rhythm, but include internal subordination.** (Short sentences, but complex within—not simplistic)
6. **Give precise spatial/temporal markers.** ("from Umuofia to Mbaino"—real geography; "seven years"—exact duration)
7. **Use understatement for dignity.** ("solid personal achievements"—not "incredible legendary feats")
8. **Honor even minor characters with full naming.** (Amalinze gets full sentence establishing his status—defeated opponent isn't dismissed)
