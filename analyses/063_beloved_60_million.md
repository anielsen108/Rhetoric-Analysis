# Passage 063: Beloved Dedication

## Author and Source
**Toni Morrison**, *Beloved* (1987), Dedication

## Passage
> Sixty Million and more

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Dedication** (ded-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Inscription honoring recipients.
*Example:* The entire phrase dedicated to enslaved Africans.
*Effect:* Makes novel memorial; transforms fiction into historical testimony.

### **Understatement** (UN-der-state-ment)
*Definition:* Restraint in expression.
*Example:* "and more" for countless uncounted dead.
*Effect:* Suggests numbers beyond counting; infinite loss.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-EK-duh-kee)
*Definition:* Part for whole.
*Example:* Number representing all enslaved peoples.
*Effect:* Makes abstract historical trauma concrete through quantity.

### **Fragment** (FRAG-ment)
*Definition:* Incomplete sentence.
*Example:* No verb, no complete predication.
*Effect:* Creates effect of inscription, memorial marker.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Numerical Opening
"Sixty Million"—**cardinal number** +  **capitalized common noun**. The capitalization of "Million" gives it weight, importance, treating it almost as proper noun.

The **specific number** (sixty, not "many" or "countless") creates documentary precision while representing approximation—we can't know exact numbers.

### Coordinate Addition
"and more"—the **coordinating conjunction** + **quantifier** suggests the number is minimum, not maximum. The syntax through "and more" makes explicit: this is uncountable.

### Absence of Verb
The dedication contains **no finite verb**—it's a **noun phrase** serving as complete utterance. This creates effect of inscription, like tombstone or memorial. Verbs imply action, time; their absence creates timeless memorial.

### Absence of Preposition
Standard dedication might say "To Sixty Million" or "For Sixty Million." Morrison omits preposition, making the number itself the dedication. The **syntax through omission** creates directness, stark simplicity.

### Capital M
The **capitalized "Million"** treats the number with respect usually reserved for proper nouns or divine names. The syntax through typography elevates.

### Stylistic Effect
Through numerical specificity, syntactic incompletion, and typographical emphasis, Morrison creates memorial that's both precise and infinite. The form IS monument—syntax stripped to essential (number + more), creating space for grief that can't be fully expressed. Grammar as gravestone.
