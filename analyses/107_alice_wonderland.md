## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "never once considering"
*Effect:* Emphasizes Alice's impulsiveness through negative construction.

### **Hyperbaton** (hy-PER-buh-tahn)
*Definition:* Inverted word order.
*Example:* "down went Alice" instead of "Alice went down"
*Effect:* Mimics the inversion of falling; creates fairy-tale syntax.

### **Tmesis** (t-MEE-sis)
*Definition:* Phrase split by intervening word.
*Example:* "how in the world" (how...world split by "in the")
*Effect:* Creates colloquial speech pattern; emphasizes bewilderment.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Temporal Transition
"In another moment"—**prepositional phrase** of time. Syntax accelerates narrative pace.

### Inverted Subject-Verb
"down went Alice"—**adverb-verb-subject** order. Syntax mimics tumbling motion through word order.

### Participial Negation
"never once considering"—**present participle** with emphatic double negative. Syntax emphasizes thoughtlessness.

### Indirect Question
"how in the world she was to get out"—**embedded question** with modal construction. Syntax presents the question she didn't ask.

### Modal Obligation
"was to get out"—**semi-modal** expressing necessity. Syntax implies future problem unrecognized in present.

### Temporal Adverb
"again"—final word emphasizes return, suggesting cycle. Syntax looks forward to consequence.

### Stylistic Effect
Through inverted syntax mimicking fall, emphatic negative participle, and embedded indirect question, Carroll creates grammar of impulsive adventure—syntax that performs Alice's headlong plunge into illogic.
