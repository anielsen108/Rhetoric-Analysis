## Author and Source

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Onomatopoeia** (ah-nuh-mat-uh-PEE-uh)
*Definition:* Words imitating sounds.
*Example:* "Brrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiing!"
*Effect:* Jolts reader into Bigger's harsh awakening.

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions.
*Example:* Three separate sentences presenting sequential actions.
*Effect:* Creates staccato rhythm; mimics abrupt awakening.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Substituting associated term.
*Example:* "A woman's voice" for the woman herself.
*Effect:* Depersonalizes, shows Bigger's alienation even from family.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Onomatopoetic Opening
"Brrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiing!"—**extended onomatopoeia** with exclamation. Syntax assaults through sound.

### Intransitive Action
"An alarm clock clanged"—**subject-verb**, simple past. Syntax presents mechanical violence.

### Prepositional Context
"in the dark and silent room"—**compound prepositional phrase**. Syntax emphasizes poverty's conditions.

### Paratactic Sequence
Three short declarative sentences. Syntax fragments awakening into discrete, unconnected moments.

### Indefinite Articles
"An alarm...A bed spring...A woman's voice"—**indefinite articles** throughout. Syntax makes even familiar things alien.

### Imperative Speech
"shut that thing off!"—**imperative** with demonstrative "that thing." Syntax shows frustration, dehumanization of object.

### Adverbial Tone
"sang out impatiently"—**adverb of manner**. Syntax marks voice's emotional quality.

### Stylistic Effect
Through onomatopoetic assault, paratactic fragmentation, indefinite articles making family strange, and imperative frustration, Wright creates syntax of alienated awakening—grammar that performs Bigger's violent entry into consciousness within cramped, harsh environment.
