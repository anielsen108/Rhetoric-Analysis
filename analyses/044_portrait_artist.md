## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Stream of Consciousness** (streem ov KON-shus-ness)
*Definition:* Narrative presenting unfiltered thought flow.
*Example:* Childlike language and run-on structure.
*Effect:* Places us inside child's consciousness; makes language developmental.

### **Fairy Tale Convention** (FAIR-ee tayl kon-VEN-shun)
*Definition:* Use of traditional story opening.
*Example:* "Once upon a time"
*Effect:* Signals this is a story, but child's version of story.

### **Neologism** (nee-AHL-oh-jiz-um)
*Definition:* Invented or baby-talk words.
*Example:* "moocow," "nicens," "baby tuckoo"
*Effect:* Represents child's developing language; makes us experience linguistic formation.

### **Parataxis** (pair-uh-TAK-sis)
*Definition:* Coordination without subordination.
*Example:* Everything connected with "and...and...and"
*Effect:* Mimics child's storytelling: additive, without hierarchy.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Fairy Tale Opening
"Once upon a time and a very good time it was"—begins with **formula** then immediately interrupts it with child's embellishment ("and a very good time it was"). The syntax starts formal then becomes conversational.

### Polysyndeton
"and a very good time...and this moocow"—the **repeated "and"** creates breathless, childlike narration. This is paratactic syntax—everything simply added, no subordination.

### Compound Word
"moocow"—the **compound noun** isn't standard English but child's word for cow. The syntax embeds developmental language naturally, without quotation marks or explanation.

### Present Participle
"was...coming down along"—the **past progressive** emphasizes ongoing action. To a child, this makes the action vivid, immediate. The syntax chooses aspectual verb form that creates presence.

### Redundant Modification
"coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road"—**repeats the same information**. Standard writing would eliminate redundancy, but child's syntax repeats for emphasis, for the pleasure of saying it again.

### Relative Clause
"that was coming down along the road"—the **restrictive relative clause** identifies which moocow, though there's only one in the story. Child syntax doesn't know that this identification is unnecessary.

### Compound Subject
"met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo"—the syntax includes three identifiers:
- article + adjective: "a nicens [nice + s]" (wrong morphology)
- adjective: "little"
- past participle: "named"

Each adds information,  accumulating detail as child would.

### Baby Talk Morphology
"nicens"—adds **plural morpheme -s** where it doesn't belong. "baby tuckoo"—probably Stephen's childhood nickname. The syntax incorporates language errors that reveal cognitive development.

### No Punctuation Pauses
The sentence is **one long run-on**, connected only by conjunctions. The syntax refuses standard pauses (periods, semicolons), creating the breathless quality of child narration.

### Stylistic Effect
Through baby-talk vocabulary, paratactic accumulation, and run-on structure, Joyce creates syntax that IS child consciousness. The form doesn't describe developmental language—it PERFORMS it. We don't observe the child from outside; we experience language formation from inside. This is Tufte's principle radicalized: syntax as consciousness at its most fundamental—language itself being born.
