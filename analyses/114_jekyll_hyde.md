# Passage 114: "The Strange Case"

## Author and Source
**Robert Louis Stevenson**, *Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde* (1886)

## Passage
> I learned to recognize the thorough and primitive duality of man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Seemingly contradictory statement.
*Example:* "I could...be said to be either...only because I was...both"
*Effect:* Captures impossible duality of single identity.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Consciousness as "field" where natures "contend"
*Effect:* Makes psyche into battlefield.

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus)
*Definition:* Inverted parallel.
*Example:* "two natures...either...both" (plurality to singularity to plurality)
*Effect:* Performs the oscillation between unity and division.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Infinitive Learning
"I learned to recognize"—**verb of cognition with infinitive object**. Syntax marks epistemological journey.

### Definite Article Universalizing
"the thorough and primitive duality of man"—**definite article** makes personal discovery universal truth. Syntax generalizes from self to species.

### Compound Adjectives
"thorough and primitive"—**two adjectives** modify duality. Syntax emphasizes completeness and originality of split.

### Relative Clause Specification
"of the two natures that contended"—**genitive with relative clause**. Syntax defines natures through their conflict.

### Prepositional Metaphor
"in the field of my consciousness"—**spatial metaphor** for mental state. Syntax makes mind into terrain of battle.

### Conditional Concession
"even if I could rightly be said to be either"—**conditional clause** with modal and passive. Syntax admits doubt about singular identity.

### Causal Paradox
"it was only because I was radically both"—**causal clause** with adverb "radically." Syntax makes wholeness depend on division.

### Stylistic Effect
Through learning infinitive, battlefield metaphor, conditional concession, and paradoxical causal clause (either BECAUSE both), Stevenson creates syntax of psychological division—grammar that performs the impossibility of unified identity when consciousness contains irreconcilable natures.
