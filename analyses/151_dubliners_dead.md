# Passage 151: "The Dead" (from *Dubliners*)

## Author and Source
**James Joyce**, *Dubliners* - "The Dead" (1914)

## Passage
> His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus)
*Definition:* Inverted parallel structure.
*Example:* "falling faintly...faintly falling"
*Effect:* Creates musical reversal, echoing snowfall.

### **Alliteration** (uh-lit-uh-RAY-shun)
*Definition:* Repeated consonant sounds.
*Example:* "falling faintly...faintly falling"
*Effect:* Mimics soft sound of snow.

### **Simile** (SIM-uh-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* Snow "like the descent of their last end"
*Effect:* Compares snowfall to death's approach.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "the living and the dead"
*Effect:* Collapses distinction between states of being.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Possessive Subject
"His soul"—**possessive with abstract noun**. Syntax makes soul the grammatical agent.

### Intransitive Swoon
"swooned slowly"—**intransitive verb** with manner adverb. Syntax shows passive surrender.

### Temporal Subordinate
"as he heard"—**temporal conjunction**. Syntax makes hearing simultaneous with swooning.

### Object Clause
"the snow falling faintly"—**noun phrase** with present participle. Syntax embeds action in perception.

### Prepositional Vastness
"through the universe"—**spatial preposition** with maximal extent. Syntax makes local snow cosmic.

### Chiastic Repetition
"falling faintly...faintly falling"—**reversed word order**. Syntax performs musical variation.

### Simile Structure
"like the descent of their last end"—**comparative preposition** with euphemistic phrase. Syntax compares physical to metaphysical falling.

### Universal Scope
"upon all the living and the dead"—**universal quantifier** with antithetical pair. Syntax erases boundary between life and death.

### Stylistic Effect
Through possessive soul swooning, subordinate hearing, participial falling, chiastic musical repetition, cosmic spatial scope, euphemistic death-descent simile, and universal erasure of living/dead distinction, Joyce creates syntax of epiphanic dissolution—grammar that performs Gabriel's ego-death through the infinite gentle falling of snow upon all existence.
