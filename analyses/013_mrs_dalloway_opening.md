## Rhetorical Tropes

### **In Medias Res** (in MAY-dee-us RAYZ)
*Definition:* Beginning in the middle of action.
*Example:* The novel opens with a decision already made, conversation already in progress.
*Effect:* Plunges reader immediately into the day; creates sense of ongoing life.

### **Free Indirect Discourse** (free in-duh-REKT DIS-kors)
*Definition:* Narration that blends narrator's voice with character's thoughts.
*Example:* The entire passage hovers between narrator and Clarissa's consciousness.
*Effect:* Creates intimacy with character while maintaining narrative perspective.

### **Parataxis** (pair-uh-TAK-sis)
*Definition:* Coordination of clauses without subordination.
*Example:* Short sentences placed side by side without explicit logical connection.
*Effect:* Mimics thought process; creates accumulation without hierarchy.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Substitution of attribute or associated term for thing meant.
*Example:* "Rumpelmayer's men" for the catering staff; "the flowers" for party preparations.
*Effect:* Creates specificity through synecdoche; makes abstract preparation concrete.

### **Understatement** (UN-der-state-ment)
*Definition:* Deliberate restraint in expression.
*Example:* "had her work cut out for her"—understating what must be extensive preparations.
*Effect:* Creates very British sense of decorum; suggests much through saying little.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Statement
"Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself"—this is **free indirect discourse**, one of Woolf's signature techniques. The syntax could be direct quotation ("I will buy the flowers myself") or pure narration ("Mrs. Dalloway decided to buy the flowers herself"), but it's neither. Instead, it uses past tense narration ("said") with preserved modal structure from speech ("would buy").

The syntax maintains the third person ("she") and past tense ("said," "would") of narration while preserving the character's voice ("herself"—a word that suggests emphasis, as if someone had contested this plan).

### Subject Position
The sentence begins with **full name "Mrs. Dalloway"** rather than a pronoun. This is the novel's first word—we meet the character through her social title and married name. The syntax establishes her as a social being before we know her thoughts or feelings.

The formality of "Mrs. Dalloway" (not "Clarissa") will be maintained throughout, creating syntactic distance even as the prose enters deep into her consciousness—a characteristic Woolf tension between social surface and interior life.

### Emphatic Reflexive
"herself"—the **reflexive pronoun** is key. It suggests: (1) she will do it personally (not delegate), (2) this is unusual or notable, (3) there's an implicit contrast with someone else doing it. The syntax contains social information through a single word: we learn about household hierarchy and Clarissa's relationship to her servants.

The placement of "herself" at sentence end gives it emphasis—this is the point of the statement.

### Explanatory Fragment
"For Lucy had her work cut out for her"—this **subordinate clause** introduced by the coordinating conjunction "For"** explains the previous sentence. However, Woolf has made it a separate sentence, giving it unusual independence.

This is characteristic of Woolf's syntax: what should be subordinate clauses become independent sentences, creating what Tufte calls **syntactic fragmentation that mimics thought**. The mind doesn't think in perfectly subordinated structures; it thinks in associative leaps and additions.

### Idiomatic Expression
"had her work cut out for her"—this is an **idiomatic phrase**, colloquial and understated. The syntax doesn't elaborate on what work or why. The cliché stands in for explanation, suggesting a shared understanding between narrator and reader.

The structure "had her [noun] cut out for her" uses **passive voice** (the work is cut out; we don't know by whom) embedded in an active construction (Lucy has it). This layered syntax creates distance from agency.

### Paratactic Addition
"The doors would be taken off their hinges"—another short sentence, coordinate with but not explicitly connected to what precedes. The syntax doesn't say "because" or "therefore"—it simply adds another fact.

This is **pure parataxis**—independent clauses that invite the reader to supply the logical connections. Woolf trusts us to understand these are party preparations without stating it directly.

### Passive Voice
"would be taken off"—the **passive construction** is significant. We don't need to know who will remove the doors; the action is what matters. The passive allows focus on the process rather than the agent.

The **modal auxiliary "would"** creates futurity but also suggests routine or plan—this is what customarily happens for parties.

### Concrete Detail
"off their hinges"—this **prepositional phrase** provides specific physical detail. The syntax moves from abstract (preparations) to concrete (hinges). This is characteristic of Woolf: anchoring consciousness in physical reality through syntactic detail.

The specificity of "hinges" makes the preparation real—doors don't just open wider, they come off their hinges. The syntax captures the scale of effort.

### Semicolon Connection
"The doors would be taken off their hinges; Rumpelmayer's men were coming"—these two **independent clauses** are joined by **semicolon** rather than period or conjunction. The semicolon suggests connection without specifying its nature.

Grammatically, these are separate sentences. Syntactically, the semicolon creates intimate relationship—these facts are related, and the reader should understand how without being told.

### Progression to Proper Noun
"Rumpelmayer's men"—the syntax finally gives us a **proper noun**, a specific name. This grounds the abstract preparations in London social reality. Rumpelmayer's was a real caterer, known to Woolf's original readers.

The **possessive construction** ("Rumpelmayer's") followed by "men" creates social hierarchy through syntax: the establishment owns or employs these men. The syntax is both specific (Rumpelmayer's, not another caterer) and vague (men, not their individual names).

### Simple Past Progressive
"were coming"—the **past progressive tense** expresses ongoing action or plan. The syntax makes the future present through grammatical aspect. We're experiencing Clarissa's anticipation, her sense of events in motion.

The verb "coming" is simple, almost ominous in its simplicity. The syntax doesn't elaborate—the fact of their coming is enough.

### Sentence Length Variation
Note the progression:
1. First sentence: 11 words (complex structure)
2. Second sentence: 10 words (simple structure)
3. Third sentence: 11 words (semicolon creates balance)
4. Fourth sentence: 5 words (declarative simplicity)

This **rhythmic variation** within consistent brevity creates what Tufte calls **syntactic vitality**—no two sentences have exactly the same structure, yet they all feel part of a unified consciousness.

### Accumulation Without Climax
The passage **accumulates details** (flowers, Lucy's work, doors, caterers) without building to a climax or conclusion. This is what Tufte would call **loose or cumulative structure** taken to an extreme—we could add more sentences indefinitely in the same pattern.

This syntactic openness mirrors the novel's stream-of-consciousness technique: one thought leads to another without necessary closure.

### Absence of Psychological Depth Markers
Remarkably, the syntax contains **no explicit psychological vocabulary**. We get actions and plans ("said," "would buy," "had," "would be taken," "were coming") but no feelings ("thought," "felt," "worried," "anticipated"). Yet through free indirect discourse and paratactic accumulation, we understand Clarissa's state of mind perfectly.

This is syntax doing psychological work without psychological language—the structure reveals consciousness.

### Stylistic Effect
Through free indirect discourse, paratactic construction, and strategic fragmentation, Woolf creates prose that **flows like thought itself**. The syntax doesn't explain or analyze Clarissa's consciousness; it presents it directly. The short sentences accumulate without hierarchy because that's how anticipation and preparation feel—one thing after another, each seemingly equal in importance, yet together creating the pressure and excitement of the day ahead.

As Tufte emphasizes, this is **syntax as stream of consciousness**—the form mimics the movement of mind through time and social space. The deceptive simplicity of these opening sentences, their accumulation of small details through paratactic coordination, creates one of the most influential opening passages in modernist literature. The syntax IS the psychology. Form and content achieve perfect unity in prose that seems transparent while being exquisitely crafted.
