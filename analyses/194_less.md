# Passage 194: "Less"

## Author and Source
**Andrew Sean Greer**, *Less* (2017)

## Passage
> Arthur Less is a failed novelist about to turn fifty. A wedding invitation arrives in the mail: his boyfriend of the past nine years is engaged to someone else.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to surface.
*Example:* "his boyfriend...is engaged to someone else"
*Effect:* Makes "boyfriend" status immediately obsolete.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement.
*Example:* "failed novelist" - blunt self-assessment.
*Effect:* Opens with protagonist's low self-image.

### **Juxtaposition** (juhk-stuh-puh-ZI-shun)
*Definition:* Placing contrasting elements together.
*Example:* Turning fifty + ex-boyfriend's wedding.
*Effect:* Doubles protagonist's crisis.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Copulative Introduction
"Arthur Less is a failed novelist"—**subject-copula-complement**. Syntax defines protagonist through failure.

### Participial Modifier
"failed"—**past participle** as adjective. Syntax makes failure definitional.

### Progressive Turning
"about to turn fifty"—**aspectual preposition** with infinitive. Syntax shows imminence.

### Intransitive Arrival
"A wedding invitation arrives"—**indefinite subject** with present tense. Syntax makes invitation into agent.

### Prepositional Mail
"in the mail"—**locative preposition**. Syntax shows mundane delivery of devastating news.

### Possessive Boyfriend
"his boyfriend of the past nine years"—**possessive with temporal genitive**. Syntax claims relationship despite past tense.

### Copulative Engagement
"is engaged to someone else"—**present tense copula** with vague other. Syntax makes current fact.

### Indefinite Someone
"someone else"—**indefinite pronoun** with alternative. Syntax refuses to name replacement.

### Stylistic Effect
Through copulative is-failed-novelist opening definition, progressive about-to-turn-fifty imminence, intransitive invitation-arrives agency, possessive his-boyfriend-of-nine-years claim, copulative is-engaged present fact, and indefinite someone-else nameless replacement, Greer creates syntax of accumulating crisis—grammar that stacks protagonist's professional failure, aging milestone, and romantic loss into compressed opening establishing multiple humiliations.
