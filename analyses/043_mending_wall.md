# Passage 043: "Mending Wall"

## Author and Source
**Robert Frost**, *North of Boston* (1914)

## Passage
> Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
> That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
> And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
> And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Inversion** (in-VER-zhun)
*Definition:* Reversal of normal word order.
*Example:* "Something there is" instead of "There is something"
*Effect:* Creates formal, archaic tone; emphasizes "Something" by fronting it.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nif-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Attributing human qualities to non-human things.
*Example:* Something that "doesn't love"
*Effect:* Makes natural force seem conscious, willful.

### **Polysyndeton** (pol-ee-SIN-duh-ton)
*Definition:* Use of multiple conjunctions.
*Example:* "And spills...And makes"
*Effect:* Creates accumulation of effects; suggests ongoing, relentless process.

### **Concrete Diction** (KON-kreet DIK-shun)
*Definition:* Use of specific, tangible language.
*Example:* "frozen-ground-swell," "upper boulders," "gaps"
*Effect:* Makes abstract idea (resistance to walls) physically real.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Inversion
"Something there is that doesn't love a wall"—the **inverted syntax** (fronting "Something") creates mystery. Normal order would be "There is something that doesn't love a wall." The inversion makes "Something" the syntactic focus—we don't know what it is, only that it exists and acts.

### Indefinite Pronoun
"Something"—the **vague pronoun** refuses to name the force. Is it nature? Frost keeps it syntactically indefinite, forcing us to wonder.

### Negative Construction
"doesn't love"—the **negative verb** with human emotion ("love") applied to non-human thing. The syntax through negation is less direct than "hates" or "destroys," suggesting subtle opposition.

### Relative Clause Series
"That sends...And spills...And makes"—a series of **relative clauses** all modifying "Something." The syntax accumulates the force's actions without pause.

### Hyphenated Compound
"frozen-ground-swell"—this **compound noun** creates specificity through syntax. Three concepts unified by hyphens into one geological phenomenon.

### Parallel Verb Phrases
The **three verbs** (sends, spills, makes) are parallel in structure but build in effect:
- sends (initiates movement)
- spills (causes disorder)
- makes (creates openings)

The syntax through accumulation shows progressive destruction of the wall.

### Final Result Clause
"And makes gaps even two can pass abreast"—this clause specifies the size of gaps through **human measurement** ("two can pass abreast"). The syntax shifts from natural forces to human scale, making the destruction personal, relational.

### Enjambment
Each line **runs into the next** without pause, mimicking the continuous work of the force that undermines walls. The syntax doesn't pause for line breaks, just as the force doesn't pause in its work.

### Stylistic Effect
Through inverted syntax, accumulating clauses, and enjambment, Frost creates form that enacts content. The mysterious "Something" remains syntactically indefinite while its effects accumulate grammatically. The syntax refuses to name what opposes walls, keeping it as vague and powerful as natural law itself. Form IS content—resistance to walls performed through resistant syntax.
