# Passage 143: "The Age of Innocence" - Newland's Realization

## Author and Source
**Edith Wharton**, *The Age of Innocence* (1920)

## Passage
> It was the old New York way of taking life "without effusion of blood": the way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease, who placed decency above courage, and who considered that nothing was more ill-bred than "scenes."

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "scandal more than disease"; "decency above courage"
*Effect:* Shows inverted values of society.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "who dreaded...who placed...who considered"
*Effect:* Accumulates indictments of social code.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "without effusion of blood" for conflict avoidance.
*Effect:* Mocks society's genteel language for cowardice.

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to surface.
*Example:* "ill-bred" applied to emotional honesty.
*Effect:* Exposes absurdity of valuing propriety over truth.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Copulative Definition
"It was the old New York way"—**subject-copula-complement** with definite articles. Syntax presents as established pattern.

### Genitive Specification
"of taking life"—**gerund in genitive**. Syntax defines method of living.

### Quoted Phrase
"without effusion of blood"—**euphemistic quotation**. Syntax marks phrase as society's own language.

### Relative Clause Series
"who dreaded...who placed...who considered"—**three parallel relative clauses**. Syntax accumulates defining characteristics.

### Comparative Construction
"more than disease"—**comparative structure**. Syntax creates hierarchy of fears.

### Prepositional Hierarchy
"above courage"—**spatial preposition** for values. Syntax makes abstract hierarchy spatial.

### Superlative Judgment
"nothing was more ill-bred"—**negative with comparative**. Syntax presents absolute social judgment.

### Quoted Condemnation
"scenes"—**scare quotes** on condemned behavior. Syntax shows society's own terminology for forbidden emotion.

### Stylistic Effect
Through copulative definition of "way," euphemistic quotation, anaphoric relative clauses accumulating indictments, comparative hierarchies of scandal over disease and decency over courage, and final quoted condemnation of "scenes," Wharton creates syntax of social critique—grammar that exposes society's inverted values through its own euphemistic language.
