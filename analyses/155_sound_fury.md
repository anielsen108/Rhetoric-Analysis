# Passage 155: "The Sound and the Fury"

## Author and Source
**William Faulkner**, *The Sound and the Fury* (1929)

## Passage
> Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, I could see them hitting. They were coming toward where the flag was and I went along the fence.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Fragmentation** (frag-men-TAY-shun)
*Definition:* Broken, incomplete expression.
*Example:* "see them hitting" without object.
*Effect:* Renders Benjy's incomplete comprehension.

### **Deixis** (DIKE-sis)
*Definition:* Pointing words.
*Example:* "them," "where the flag was," "the fence"
*Effect:* Shows narrator can only point, not name or understand.

### **Parataxis** (pair-uh-TAK-sis)
*Definition:* Clauses without subordination.
*Example:* "They were coming...and I went"
*Effect:* Flattens causality, no hierarchy of importance.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Prepositional Layering
"Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces"—**two spatial prepositions**. Syntax shows fragmented perception through barriers.

### Adjectival Oddity
"curling flower spaces"—**unusual modifier**. Syntax renders garden through limited vocabulary.

### Modal Perception
"I could see"—**modal verb** of ability. Syntax emphasizes perception as accomplishment.

### Object Pronoun
"them"—**pronoun without clear antecedent**. Syntax shows inability to name actors.

### Intransitive Hitting
"hitting"—**present participle** without object. Syntax makes golf incomprehensible, verb without target.

### Progressive Approach
"were coming toward"—**past progressive** with directional preposition. Syntax shows ongoing movement without understanding destination.

### Locative Clause
"where the flag was"—**adverbial clause** of place. Syntax can locate but not interpret flag's significance.

### Coordinate Response
"and I went along the fence"—**coordinating conjunction** linking observation to action. Syntax makes response automatic, un-reasoned.

### Stylistic Effect
Through layered spatial prepositions, odd adjectival flower-spaces, modal perception, unclear pronouns, objectless hitting, progressive movement toward incomprehensible flag, and paratactic coordinate response, Faulkner creates syntax of cognitive disability—grammar that performs Benjy's consciousness through fragmented deixis and inability to subordinate, name, or causally connect events.
