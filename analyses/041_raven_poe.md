## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Alliteration** (uh-lit-uh-RAY-shun)
*Definition:* Repetition of initial consonant sounds.
*Example:* "weak and weary"; "nodded, nearly napping"; "quaint and curious"
*Effect:* Creates musical, hypnotic quality; emphasizes key words.

### **Internal Rhyme** (in-TER-nul ryme)
*Definition:* Rhyme within a line.
*Example:* "dreary/weary"; "napping/tapping/rapping"
*Effect:* Creates dense sonic texture; makes verse memorable and incantatory.

### **Epizeuxis** (ep-ih-ZOOK-sis)
*Definition:* Immediate repetition for emphasis.
*Example:* "rapping, rapping"
*Effect:* Creates obsessive focus on the sound; builds tension.

### **Archaism** (AR-kay-iz-um)
*Definition:* Use of old-fashioned language.
*Example:* "quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore"
*Effect:* Creates Gothic atmosphere; suggests speaker lives in past.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Fairy Tale Opening
"Once upon a midnight dreary"—begins with **formulaic phrase** "Once upon" (fairy tale convention), but modifies "midnight" with "dreary," creating Gothic mood. The syntax signals: this is a story, but dark.

### Subordinate While-Clauses
The passage uses **two "while" clauses** before reaching main action:
- "while I pondered, weak and weary"
- "While I nodded, nearly napping"

This **delayed main clause** creates suspense through syntax.

### Participial Pairs
"weak and weary"; "nodded, nearly napping"—the syntax uses **coordinated modifiers** that alliterate. The form is as musical as the content.

### Object Elaboration
"many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore"—the **object** is heavily modified with archaic construction "many a" (not "many") plus multiple adjectives. The syntax is deliberately antiquated, matching the Gothic setting.

### Main Clause Finally
"suddenly there came a tapping"—after two subordinate clauses, the **main clause** uses inverted syntax: "there came" instead of "a tapping came." This inversion plus "suddenly" creates dramatic impact.

### Simile and Repetition
"As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door"—the **comparative "As of"** creates uncertainty (like someone, but maybe not?), and the **repeated "rapping"** obsessively focuses on the sound.

### Stylistic Effect
Through internal rhyme, alliteration, delayed main clause, and archaic syntax, Poe creates hypnotic, musical prose that performs obsession. The form IS the psychological state—repetitive, circular, unable to escape the tapping. Syntax as madness barely contained by meter.
