# Passage 019: The Metamorphosis Opening

**Franz Kafka** · *The Metamorphosis* (trans. David Wyllie) · 1915 | Opening sentence

**Occasion/Pressure:** Novella's threshold; must establish impossible premise without preamble, forcing reader acceptance through matter-of-fact syntax.
**Persona/Stance:** Third-person limited; voice performs bureaucratic flatness, treating nightmare as routine report.
**Thesis of Effect:** Subordinate clause buries transformation mid-sentence—syntax normalizes horror through grammatical subordination, making the impossible feel inevitable.

## PASSAGE

[L1] As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed
[L2] in his bed into a gigantic insect.

---

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **In Medias Res** (in MAY-dee-us RAYZ / ɪn ˈmeɪdiəs ˈreɪz)
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Beginning narrative in middle of action, after crucial events.
**Evidence:** Story opens with transformation already completed—"he found himself transformed." No origin story, no process. Discovery, not metamorphosis itself.
**Effect:** Forces immediate acceptance. No time to question how/why. Reader positioned as Gregor is—waking to find change already accomplished.
**Near-miss:** Not *ab ovo* (from beginning): Kafka refuses causality, explanation. We enter post-transformation.
**Risk:** Could alienate readers who expect setup. Kafka uses risk to create absurdist effect—world where transformations need no explanation.

### **Litotes / Understatement** (LY-tuh-teez / ˈlaɪtətiːz)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Deliberate restraint in expression, often through negation or minimal description.
**Evidence:** "uneasy dreams"—massive understatement for whatever dreams precede waking as insect. "awoke one morning"—routine phrase for impossible event.
**Effect:** Bureaucratic flatness. Kafka's trademark tone—treating nightmare as administrative detail. Reader experiences cognitive dissonance: form says normal, content says impossible.
**Near-miss:** Not meiosis (simple understatement): litotes often involves negation, here through minimal description.
**Risk:** Could fail to engage—too flat, too restrained. Kafka's genius is making restraint itself horrifying.

### **Periphrasis** (peh-RIF-ruh-sis / pəˈrɪfrəsɪs)
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Roundabout expression; using more words than necessary.
**Evidence:** "found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect"—long prepositional phrase delays and specifies. Could be "woke as an insect."
**Effect:** The syntax performs discovery—Gregor processes transformation part by part: found himself, transformed, in bed, into... what? Insect. Reader experiences realization in stages.
**Near-miss:** Not circumlocution (evasive): this is precise accumulation, not avoidance.
**Risk:** Could feel wordy. Here, the expansion creates horror through incremental revelation.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-EK-duh-kee / sɪˈnɛkdəki)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Part stands for whole or vice versa.
**Evidence:** "awoke...from uneasy dreams"—dreams stand for entire night's unconscious state. "one morning"—single morning stands for any/every morning.
**Effect:** The particular becomes universal. This isn't just Gregor's story—"one morning" could be any morning. Reader recognizes archetypal anxiety: waking to find self changed.
**Near-miss:** Not metonymy (associated concept): synecdoche is specifically part-whole relationship.
**Risk:** Specificity could limit universality. Kafka balances: "Gregor Samsa" (specific) vs. "one morning" (generic).

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee / haɪˈpɜːrbəli)
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Deliberate exaggeration for effect.
**Evidence:** "gigantic insect"—not just transformed, but made gigantic. The nightmare is hyperbolic.
**Effect:** Alienation made physical, extreme, undeniable. Can't minimize or rationalize. The body is monstrous. Reader confronts horror that cannot be talked away.
**Near-miss:** Not auxesis (amplification through accumulation): this is single exaggerated descriptor.
**Risk:** Could tip into parody or camp. Kafka's flat delivery keeps it terrifying.

### **Oxymoron** (ahk-see-MOR-on / ˌɒksɪˈmɔːrɒn)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Conjunction of contradictory terms.
**Evidence:** "uneasy dreams"—dreams are usually escape, ease, wish-fulfillment. "Uneasy" makes them contradictory—restlessness where rest should be.
**Effect:** Even sleep offers no refuge. The unease predates transformation—or does transformation reflect prior unease? Reader confronts causality's collapse.
**Near-miss:** Not paradox (apparent contradiction revealing truth): oxymoron is simpler conjunction of opposites.
**Risk:** "Uneasy dreams" could seem cliché. In context of sentence, it gains weight.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Hyperbaton** (hy-PER-buh-ton / haɪˈpɜːrbətɒn)
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Inversion or unusual arrangement of words.
**Evidence:** Normal order: "As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed into a gigantic insect in his bed." Kafka inverts: "transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect"—placing "in his bed" before final revelation.
**Effect:** Syntax delays climax. "Transformed" dangles—into what? "In his bed"—domestic detail before horror. Then: "gigantic insect." Reader's eyes perform discovery in stages.
**Risk:** Could confuse or dilute impact. Kafka uses delay to intensify.

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-ton / əˈsɪndətɒn)
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Omission of conjunctions.
**Evidence:** "awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself"—no "and" between clauses. Could be "awoke...and found himself."
**Effect:** Causal ambiguity. Did dreams cause transformation? Or coincide with discovery? Reader cannot separate waking from finding. They are one action.
**Risk:** Could feel like run-on. Here, the fusion is thematic—waking = discovering.

### **Polyptoton** (puh-LIP-tuh-ton / pəˈlɪptətɒn)
**Lines:** L1-2 (implicit)
**Definition:** Repetition of word in different grammatical forms.
**Evidence:** "transformed" (past participle)—implies "transformation" (noun), "transform" (verb). The word-family saturates though only one form appears.
**Effect:** The concept of change dominates. Even though word appears once, its centrality makes reader feel the echo.
**Near-miss:** Not conduplicatio (exact word repetition): polyptoton varies the form.
**Risk:** Stretch to claim when word appears once. But thematically, transformation is the passage's entire content.

### **Parenthesis** (puh-REN-thuh-sis / pəˈrɛnθəsɪs)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Insertion of clause interrupting main grammatical structure.
**Evidence:** "As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams"—entire clause delays main subject-verb ("he found himself").
**Effect:** Subordinate clause is long, detailed, delaying. Reader held in suspense—who awoke? What did they find? Syntax makes us wait.
**Risk:** Could feel like throat-clearing. Kafka uses the delay strategically—normalcy before horror.

### **Anastrophe** (uh-NAS-truh-fee / əˈnæstrəfi)
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Inversion of expected word order.
**Evidence:** "transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect"—expected: "transformed into a gigantic insect in his bed" (object before location).
**Effect:** "In his bed" before "gigantic insect"—domesticity before monstrosity. Syntax moves from safe to horrifying.
**Risk:** Inversion could feel arbitrary. Here it's strategic—moving from known to unknown.

### **Prolepsis** (proh-LEP-sis / proʊˈlɛpsɪs)
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Anticipating objections or treating future event as already occurred.
**Evidence:** "found himself transformed"—past participle treats metamorphosis as already completed. Not "was transforming" (progressive) but transformed (perfective).
**Effect:** No process shown—only result. Reader cannot witness transformation, only its aftermath. Like Gregor, we discover fait accompli.
**Risk:** Could feel like withholding. Kafka uses it to heighten absurdity—world where transformations complete offstage.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Subordinate Clause Fronting (As-Clause Delay)**
**Lines:** L1
**Signals:**
- "As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams"—entire subordinate clause precedes main clause.
- Subject of main clause ("he") doesn't appear until after 11 words.
**Effect on stance:** Subordination normalizes. "As" suggests routine: As he awoke (as he always does), he found... Reader expects continuation of normality. Main clause subverts.
**Classical kin:** Periodic sentence (delaying completion), but modern in treating nightmare as subordinate background.

### **Passive Participle (Transformation as State, Not Process)**
**Lines:** L1-2
**Signals:**
- "found himself transformed"—passive perfect participle.
- No active verb ("someone/something transformed him"), no process shown.
**Effect on stance:** Agency deleted. Who transformed him? How? Irrelevant. Reader experiences transformation as metaphysical fact, not caused event.
**Classical kin:** Passive voice, but modernist in refusing causality itself.

### **Prepositional Phrase Accretion**
**Lines:** L1-2
**Signals:**
- "awoke...from uneasy dreams" (source)
- "found himself...in his bed" (location)
- "transformed...into a gigantic insect" (result)
**Effect on stance:** Three prepositional phrases specify without explaining. Each adds detail (from/in/into), none add causality. Reader gets geography, not logic.
**Classical kin:** Prepositional cascade, but modern in accumulating circumstance without providing reason.

### **Pronoun Before Full Noun (He before Gregor)**
**Lines:** L1
**Signals:**
- "As Gregor Samsa awoke...he found himself"—pronoun appears after full name established.
- Immediate pronoun substitution (Gregor → he).
**Effect on stance:** Name introduced, then disappeared into pronoun. Gregor becomes "he"—anonymized, universal. Reader recognizes shift from individual to type.
**Classical kin:** Anaphoric pronoun, but modernist in speed of substitution—name barely established before replaced.

### **End-Weight (Horror at Sentence End)**
**Lines:** L2
**Signals:**
- "gigantic insect" occupies final position—heaviest information load at end.
- Sentence builds through awoke → found → transformed → in bed → into... [pause] gigantic insect.
**Effect on stance:** Climactic structure. Everything builds to revelation. Reader's eye travels to sentence end for horror's culmination.
**Classical kin:** Periodic structure, but modern in using syntax to perform suspense within single sentence.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** L1 opens with fricatives: "As...Samsa...awoke" (s/s/s)—hissing, unsettling. Then plosives: "Gregor...bed...gigantic" (g/b/g)—hard consonants. The mouth shifts from sibilance to percussion.

**Cadence seams:** No internal punctuation until period after "insect." One long sentence—54 words in Wyllie translation. The period is sole pause—relief and horror combined. Sentence must be said in one breath; reader feels breathlessness.

**Alliteration:** "Samsa...awoke...morning" (s-m pattern); "found...himself" (f/h); "bed...into" (no strong pattern); "gigantic...insect" (hard-g / ins-).

**Assonance:** "Gregor...awoke...one...morning...from" (o-sounds dominate first clause); "found...himself" (short-e); "transformed...in" (different patterns).

**Rhythm:** "as GREG-or SAM-sa a-WOKE one MORN-ing from un-EAS-y DREAMS he FOUND him-SELF trans-FORMED in his BED in-TO a gi-GAN-tic IN-sect"—iambs and anapests. Roughly: weak-STRONG throughout, building toward "gigantic INsect."

**Music argues:** The ear hears routine rhythm (iambic tendency) carrying impossible content. Form says normal; content says nightmare. Prosody performs cognitive dissonance.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Single complex sentence—subordinate clause (as-clause) followed by main clause with embedded prepositional phrases.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** All subordination. "As" subordinates entire opening clause. No coordination—one sentence, hierarchical structure.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Participial:** "transformed"—past participle, passive.
- **Prepositional cascade:** "from uneasy dreams," "in his bed," "into a gigantic insect"—three phrases specifying circumstances.
- **Reflexive pronoun:** "himself"—emphasizes intransitive discovery (he found *himself*, not someone else found him).

**Inversion:** "transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect"—placing "in his bed" mid-phrase delays final horror ("gigantic insect").

**Information flow:** Old information (routine morning, waking from dreams) → new (transformation). Given (normal activity) → new (impossible result).

### Micro-rewrites:

**Compressed:** *"Gregor Samsa woke as a gigantic insect."*
**Lost:** "one morning" (everyday quality), "from uneasy dreams" (foreshadowing/causality hint), "found himself" (discovery process), "in his bed" (domestic detail). Gained: brutal directness. Lost: Kafka's slow-burn realization, bureaucratic tone.

**Dilated:** *"It was on a particular morning, a morning that seemed at first no different from any other morning, that Gregor Samsa gradually awakened from the unsettling and disturbing dreams that had troubled his sleep throughout the previous night, and as consciousness slowly returned to him, he made the shocking and inexplicable discovery that his body, lying as it had been in his familiar bed, had somehow undergone a complete and total transformation, changing him into an insect of gigantic, monstrous proportions."*
**Lost:** ALL of Kafka's restraint. The bureaucratic flatness. The matter-of-factness. Gained: Victorian over-explanation, emotional excess, subordinate clauses that kill the absurdist effect.

**Focalization shift (first-person):** *"When I woke that morning from uneasy dreams, I found I'd transformed into a gigantic insect in my bed."*
**Effect:** Immediate identification. But Kafka's third-person is crucial—slight distance lets us observe Gregor's reaction, not just be Gregor. "He" allows horrified witness perspective.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** "one morning"—temporal deixis nonspecific. Not "yesterday" or "last Tuesday" but generic "one morning." "His bed"—spatial deixis locates but doesn't specify where the bed is. Deictic vagueness universalizes: could be anyone, anywhere, any morning.

**Aspect:**
- "awoke" (simple past, perfective): completed action—waking is done.
- "found" (simple past, perfective): discovery completed.
- "transformed" (past participle, stative): state resulting from prior action. The transformation is already complete; we see result, not process.

**Modality:**
- No modal auxiliaries. No "might have," "could have," "must have." Everything declarative, factual. "He found himself transformed"—stated as fact, not possibility.
- Epistemic certainty: narrator reports as if transformation is objective reality, not hallucination or metaphor.

**Quoted locus:** No quotation, no free indirect discourse. Pure third-person narration—externalized report. Reader gets no access to Gregor's thoughts, only his discovery. The silence is louder than thought would be.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Waking/Sleep:** "awoke," "morning," "dreams," "bed"—domestic morning routine vocabulary.
2. **Unease/Transformation:** "uneasy," "transformed," "gigantic," "insect"—vocabulary of nightmare, change, monstrosity.
3. **Discovery:** "found himself"—vocabulary of realization, not memory or process.

**Lexical fields:**
- **Morning routine:** "awoke," "one morning," "bed"—everyday waking life.
- **Psychic disturbance:** "uneasy dreams"—mental unrest.
- **Physical metamorphosis:** "transformed," "gigantic insect"—body horror.

**Image logic across passage:** Movement from psychic (uneasy dreams) to physical (gigantic insect). The nightmare that was mental becomes corporeal. Interior anxiety externalized. Reader sees mind-body split collapse—what was felt becomes what is.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Third-person limited—external perspective but focused on Gregor. No omniscience (we don't know why/how transformation occurred). Psychic distance is moderate—we see his discovery but don't enter his thoughts.

**Time (Genette):**
- **Order:** Chronological. Waking → finding. But transformation itself is elided—happened "before" narrative begins (analepsis implied but not shown).
- **Duration:** Scene tempo—sentence covers seconds of waking/realizing. Real-time realization.
- **Frequency:** Singulative—one morning told once. But "one morning" implies iterative possibility: could happen any morning.

**Beat structure:** Subordinate framing (morning, dreams, waking) → main event (discovery) → specification (bed, insect). Syntax moves from routine to horror.

**Subtext:** Why "uneasy dreams"? Implies transformation reflects prior psychic state. Or: dreams warned him? Or: waking is worse than dreams? Reader must decide if transformation is literal or extended metaphor for alienation.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Narrator establishes authority through bureaucratic matter-of-factness. Reports impossible event as if filing form. Reader trusts narrator precisely because no hysteria, no explanation. The flatness is credibility.

**Pathos:** Horror through understatement. No melodrama, no exclamation. "He found himself transformed"—as if finding keys. The restraint makes horror more profound. Reader supplies the scream narrator withholds.

**Logos:** No logic offered—no "because," no causality. Transformation is brute fact. The absence of logos IS the argument: absurdist world where cause-effect collapses. Reader confronts meaninglessness as premise.

**Lines:** "As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams"—the subordinate clause performs normalcy that main clause ("he found himself transformed") explodes. Syntax IS the strategy: bury horror in grammar.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Gogol's "The Nose":** Russian absurdist precedent—body parts act autonomously, impossible events reported flatly. Kafka inherits Gogol's technique of treating surreal as mundane.

**Dostoyevsky's underground men:** Alienated consciousness, psychological extremity. Kafka makes Dostoyevsky's interior alienation physical—Gregor's body IS the underground.

**German Expressionism:** Contemporary visual art movement—distorted bodies expressing inner states. Kafka's prose is literary Expressionism—interior made grotesquely exterior.

**Freud's dream logic:** Published 1899 (*Interpretation of Dreams*). Kafka's "uneasy dreams" preceding transformation echoes Freudian unconscious erupting into conscious/body.

**Subversion:** Kafka takes 19th-century realism's faith in causality and explodes it. Where Tolstoy would explain *why* Gregor transformed, Kafka offers brute facticity. Where Dickens would resolve toward meaning, Kafka begins AND ends with meaninglessness.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots:
1. **"found himself transformed"** (L1-2)—Passive participle erases agency. Who transformed him? Universe? God? Himself? Ambiguity is load-bearing—transformation without transformer.
2. **"uneasy dreams"** (L1)—Two-word foreshadowing. If dreams were uneasy, does transformation continue that unease? Or: dreams were warning? Or: irrelevant detail making horror more banal? Reader cannot decide.
3. **"gigantic insect"** (L2)—Why "gigantic"? Why not just "insect"? The hyperbole matters—not subtle change but monstrous, undeniable. Can't be overlooked or rationalized.

### Faultlines:
1. **"one morning"** (L1)—Generic temporal marker. **Risk:** Could feel like fairy tale opening ("Once upon a time"). **Defense:** Genericness is the point—this nightmare is universal possibility. Any morning could be THE morning.
2. **"in his bed"** (L2)—Domestic detail mid-horror. **Risk:** Could dilute shock—why care WHERE he transformed? **Defense:** "Bed" is crucial—site of vulnerability, privacy, sleep. Transformation invades most intimate space.
3. **Translation issues**—Original German ("ungeheuren Ungeziefer") = "monstrous vermin," not "gigantic insect." Wyllie's choice affects tone. **Risk:** English versions vary; some say "bug," "vermin," "insect." Each creates different resonance. **Defense:** Core horror survives all translations.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

### Subtraction test:
**Remove:** "from uneasy dreams"
**Result:** "As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect."
**Loss:** Foreshadowing evaporates. "Uneasy dreams" suggests psychic disturbance predating physical transformation—maybe causality, maybe continuity. Without it, transformation is even more arbitrary, more gratuitous. Some readers prefer that stark version. Others need the hint of continuity.

### Amplification test:
**Heighten:** Add emotional interiority
**Result:** "As Gregor Samsa awoke one terrible morning from the most uneasy and disturbing dreams imaginable, he found himself, to his absolute horror and disbelief, transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect."
**Gain:** Emotional clarity—we know how to feel. **Risk:** Destroys Kafka's entire technique. The power is in the flatness. "Absolute horror and disbelief" would be Victorian melodrama. Kafka refuses to tell us how to feel.

### Register shift (formal ↔ colloquial):
**Formal:** "Upon awakening on a certain morning subsequent to a period of unsettled nocturnal visions, Gregor Samsa discovered himself to have undergone a metamorphosis, whilst reclining in his sleeping quarters, into an arthropod of considerable magnitude."
**Effect:** Becomes pompous, comic. Latinate diction ("nocturnal visions," "metamorphosis," "arthropod") destroys Kafka's plain style.

**Colloquial:** "When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning after some bad dreams, he found out he'd turned into a huge bug in his bed."
**Effect:** Too casual. "Found out," "turned into," "bug"—loses Kafka's careful word choice. "Transformed" has weight "turned into" lacks.

### Punctuation swap:
**Period → Dash:** "As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams—he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect."
**Effect:** Dash creates more dramatic pause, emphasizing break between waking and discovering. But Kafka's lack of punctuation (one sentence) is crucial—no pause to question, no breath to protest. The single period at end = acceptance.

**Add comma:** "As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect."
**Effect:** Some translations include this comma. Helps readability (clearly separates subordinate from main). But lack of comma increases breathlessness, fusion.

### Focalization nudge:
**Current:** Third-person limited
**Shift to free indirect discourse:** "As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found—how could this be?—that he had transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect."
**Effect:** Access to his shock. But Kafka's refusal of interior response is strategic—the silence is more horrifying than any articulated reaction.

### Tense shift:
**Past → Present:** "As Gregor Samsa awakes one morning from uneasy dreams he finds himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect."
**Effect:** Historical present creates immediacy. But Kafka's past tense is essential—this is report, not experience. Past tense creates slight distance, letting us observe rather than only identify.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

### Imitatio (new content, same scaffolding):
*As Josef K. arrived at the office one Tuesday from a restless commute he found himself accused in his cubicle of an unnamed crime.*

**Replicates:** "As [name] [verb]ed one [time] from [condition] he found himself [past participle] in [location] [into/of] [impossible state]." Subordinate opening, discovered transformation, specific location, nightmare stated flatly.

### Counter-Imitatio (same content, opposing scaffolding):
*It began with dreams. Gregor Samsa had been sleeping fitfully, tossing and turning, troubled by images he couldn't quite remember upon waking. Then, as consciousness slowly returned to him that morning, he became aware of something wrong. His body felt different. Strange. As he opened his eyes and looked down at himself, the terrible truth revealed itself gradually: during the night, somehow, impossibly, he had transformed. He was no longer human. He had become a gigantic insect.*

**Opposes:** Multiple sentences (not one), progressive revelation (not immediate), emotional markers ("troubled," "wrong," "terrible truth"), process shown gradually (not fait accompli), exclamation implied. Loses Kafka's compression, flatness, subordination, single-sentence structure. This is everything Kafka refuses.

### Compression (≤15 words):
*Gregor Samsa woke one morning from uneasy dreams transformed into a gigantic insect.*

**Keeps:** Name, "one morning," "uneasy dreams," "transformed," "gigantic insect." Cuts: "As" (subordinating conjunction), "found himself" (discovery process), "in his bed" (location). At 13 words, captures core but loses Kafka's syntactic subordination—the way "As" clause normalizes before main clause horrifies.

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. **Bury horror in subordinate clauses—treat nightmare as background.** ("As he awoke...he found"—subordination normalizes)
2. **Use passive participles to erase agency and causality.** ("transformed"—by whom? why? irrelevant)
3. **Delay final revelation through prepositional phrase insertion.** ("in his bed into..."—delay creates suspense)
4. **Deploy flat, bureaucratic tone for impossible content.** (Matter-of-fact diction treating nightmare as paperwork)
5. **Front-load normalcy before subverting in main clause.** (Subordinate clause = routine; main clause = horror)
6. **Use reflexive pronoun to emphasize self-discovery.** ("found himself"—not told by other, discovered alone)
7. **Let single sentence perform breathless inevitability.** (No internal punctuation—reader cannot pause to question)
