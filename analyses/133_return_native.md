## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to non-human.
*Example:* Heath "embrowned itself"
*Effect:* Makes landscape an active agent of its own transformation.

### **Neologism** (nee-AH-luh-jiz-um)
*Definition:* Invented word.
*Example:* "embrowned"
*Effect:* Creates precise verb for gradual darkening.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Associated term substituting.
*Example:* "November" for late autumn season.
*Effect:* Emphasizes temporal specificity.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Temporal Subject
"A Saturday afternoon in November"—**noun phrase** with nested prepositional phrases. Syntax makes time itself the grammatical subject.

### Progressive Approach
"was approaching the time of twilight"—**past progressive** with gerund object. Syntax shows ongoing movement toward darkness.

### Copulative Apposition
"the vast tract of unenclosed wild known as Egdon Heath"—**noun phrase** with multiple modifiers and appositive. Syntax accumulates descriptors before naming.

### Reflexive Transformation
"embrowned itself"—**reflexive verb**. Syntax makes heath agent of its own change.

### Iterative Adverbial
"moment by moment"—**repeated noun in prepositional phrase**. Syntax emphasizes gradual, continuous darkening.

### Stylistic Effect
Through temporal subject, progressive approach to twilight, accumulating descriptive apposition, reflexive neologistic verb, and iterative adverbial, Hardy creates syntax of slow transformation—grammar that performs landscape's gradual self-darkening through syntactic accumulation and reflexive agency.
