# Passage 158: Noir Forecast (*The Big Sleep*)

**Raymond Chandler** · *The Big Sleep* · 1939 | Chapter 1 opening line

**Occasion/Pressure:** Philip Marlowe walks into the Sternwood mansion; first sentence must set noir mood—sun absent, threat looming.
**Persona/Stance:** First-person detective narrator with sardonic observational voice.
**Thesis of Effect:** Approximate time markers, negative participles, and paradoxical imagery craft an atmosphere of polished gloom before any action occurs.

## PASSAGE

[L1] It was about eleven o'clock in the morning, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Litotes** (LYE-tuh-teez / ˈlaɪtoʊtiːz)
**Evidence:** "sun not shining."
**Effect:** Understates weather to convey dullness; typical Chandler negation.

### **Paradox/Oxymoron** (PAIR-uh-doks / ˈpærədɒks)
**Evidence:** "hard wet rain" inside "clearness."
**Effect:** Juxtaposes contradictory textures, reflecting moral ambiguity.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun / ˌpɜːrsənɪfɪˈkeɪʃən)
**Evidence:** Rain has "a look."
**Effect:** Weather stares back; environment feels sentient.

### **Synesthesia**
**Evidence:** Visual "look" of rain, tactile "hard," wetness described in clear air.
**Effect:** Blends senses to heighten noir unease.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Temporal Doubling**
**Evidence:** "about eleven o'clock" + "in the morning, mid October."
**Effect:** Multiple time frames create faux-precision, like detective's report.

### **Prepositional Clustering**
**Evidence:** "with…in…of."
**Effect:** Layers conditions; scene built from linked phrases.

### **Participial Negation**
**Evidence:** "not shining."
**Effect:** Action described via absence; gloom emphasized.

### **Appositive Comma Sequence**
**Evidence:** Phrases separated by commas without conjunction.
**Effect:** Gives sentence a languid, observational cadence.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Approximate Copula**
**Signals:** "It was about…"
**Effect:** Conversational accuracy; detective note-taking tone.

### **Environmental Foreshadowing**
**Signals:** Weather contradiction.
**Effect:** Atmosphere hints at tangled case; clarity hides threat.

### **Tactile Imagery**
**Signals:** "hard wet rain."
**Effect:** Makes potential rain tangible; Marlowe senses danger physically.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Alternating plosives and liquids—"hard," "wet," "rain"—deliver punchy noir rhythm.

**Cadence seams:** Commas slow pace; final phrase lengthens like gaze toward foothills.

**Alliteration:** "hard" / "rain" / "clearness" share r sounds, reinforcing rumble.

**Music argues:** Sentence glides, then lands on paradox, echoing detective's cool appraisal.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Loose sentence with main clause + string of modifiers.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** None; "It was" opens plainly.
- **Mid:** Time phrases inserted before weather description.
- **Postposed:** Prepositional phrases deliver visual/tactile details.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Coordination via commas; no subordinating conjunctions, but participles/phrases add layers.

**Information flow:** Approximate time → season → weather absence → paradoxical threat.

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"Around eleven on a mid-October morning the sun failed to shine, and the foothills looked ready for hard rain."* — Clear, lacks noir music.
- **Dilated:** *"It was somewhere around eleven on a mid-October morning, the kind where the sun couldn't be bothered, and out beyond the city the clean foothills held a hard wet promise of rain."* — Retains style but adds voicey embellishments.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Narrator present tense of observation; readers share view.

**Aspect:** Simple past capturing single moment.

**Modality:** Implied potential rain (future threat) without modal verb.

**Temporal logic:** Specific clock time + seasonal note anchor noir world.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Weather as mood indicator.**
2. **Clarity concealing danger.**

**Lexical fields:** Timekeeping, meteorology, geography.

**Image logic:** Clear foothills hold hard rain = seemingly calm world ready to break.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Marlowe's viewpoint; scene-setter before entering mansion.

**Time:** Opening moment; sets tone for investigation.

**Beat structure:** Establish time → note season → highlight absence of sun → forecast rain.

**Subtext:** Detective notices small contradictions; environment mirrors complex case.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Narrator proves observational acuity; readers trust his eye.

**Pathos:** Gloomy mood primes reader for noir tension.

**Logos:** Weather description justifies Marlowe’s mood before meeting clients.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Hardboiled lineage:** Echoes Hammett's clipped intros.

**Modernist detail:** Paradox reminiscent of Eliot's urban imagery.

**Film noir aesthetics:** Visuals prefigure cinematic chiaroscuro.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"about eleven"** — casual precision.
2. **"sun not shining"** — negative observation.
3. **"hard wet rain in the clearness"** — key paradox.

### Faultlines
1. **Potential cliché**—Chandler invents it; ensure translation retains dryness.
2. **Weather fixation** must tie to mood; later narrative confirms.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove "about"—sentence becomes too formal; loses conversational tone.

**Amplification test:** Add "and the air smelled of rust"—could enrich but risk overload.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"It was approximately eleven o'clock on a mid-October morning…"*
- **Colloquial:** *"It was around eleven on a mid-October morning…"*

**Punctuation swap:** Replace commas with semicolons; would stiffen flow, reduce languid rhythm.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *It was about midnight in late April, with neon sweating in the fog and a taste of metal waiting above the rooftops.*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *It was eleven on a cloudy mid-October morning.* — Flat, no noir tension.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *It was about eleven on a mid-October morning, the sun not shining, the clear foothills holding a hard, wet promise of rain.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Approximate clock time for conversational authority.
2. Stack temporal modifiers to sound like reportorial observation.
3. Describe weather via negation to imply mood.
4. Fuse contradictory adjectives to hint at moral complexity.
5. Let geography (foothills) reflect looming threat.
6. Use prepositional chains to build scene gradually.
7. Personify weather subtly to make atmosphere an accomplice.
