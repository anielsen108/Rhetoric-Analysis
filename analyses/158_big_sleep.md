# Passage 158: "The Big Sleep"

## Author and Source
**Raymond Chandler**, *The Big Sleep* (1939)

## Passage
> It was about eleven o'clock in the morning, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Seeming contradiction.
*Example:* "hard wet rain in the clearness"
*Effect:* Creates oxymoronic atmospheric tension.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "sun not shining" instead of "cloudy"
*Effect:* Emphasizes absence through negative construction.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Rain having a "look"
*Effect:* Makes weather ominous, threatening.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Copulative Approximation
"It was about eleven o'clock"—**existential copula** with approximation. Syntax refuses precision while seeming specific.

### Temporal Specification
"in the morning, mid October"—**two time phrases** without conjunction. Syntax stacks temporal markers.

### Prepositional Phrase Series
"with the sun not shining"—**instrumental preposition** introducing condition. Syntax makes weather part of scene's essence.

### Participle Negation
"not shining"—**negated present participle**. Syntax emphasizes what's absent rather than what's present.

### Nominal Phrase
"a look of hard wet rain"—**indefinite article** with abstract noun. Syntax makes potential rain into visible quality.

### Adjectival Contradiction
"hard wet rain"—**two adjectives** that shouldn't coexist with "clearness". Syntax creates impossible atmospheric conditions.

### Prepositional Location
"in the clearness of the foothills"—**spatial preposition** with paradoxical quality. Syntax places threatening rain inside clarity.

### Stylistic Effect
Through approximated time, stacked temporal markers, instrumental negated sunshine, nominal look-of-rain, contradictory hard-wet-clear adjectives, and paradoxical location of rain inside clearness, Chandler creates syntax of noir atmosphere—grammar that makes weather portentous and contradictory, reflecting moral ambiguity of detective fiction world.
