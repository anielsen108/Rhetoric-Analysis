## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Personification** (per-sah-nif-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Attribution of human qualities to non-human things.
*Example:* Death as gentleman caller with a carriage.
*Effect:* Transforms terror into courtesy; makes death familiar, even social.

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Expression opposite to literal meaning.
*Example:* Death is "kindly"—typically not how we view death.
*Effect:* Creates unsettling tone; challenges assumptions about death.

### **Litotes** (LIE-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement using negative construction.
*Example:* "could not stop"—understating that humans cannot control death.
*Effect:* Creates genteel, understated tone appropriate for Victorian sensibility.

### **Capitalization** (kap-ih-tul-ih-ZAY-shun)
*Definition:* Use of capital letters for emphasis or personification.
*Example:* Death, He, Carriage, Ourselves, Immortality—all capitalized.
*Effect:* Elevates concepts to allegorical status; creates formality.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Subordinate Opening
"Because I could not stop for Death"—begins with **subordinate conjunction**, creating dependent clause before independent. The syntax inverts normal order (usually main clause first), creating suspense.

The **modal negative** "could not" expresses inability, not unwillingness. The syntax through modal choice indicates death isn't something we choose.

### Dash as Syntax
Dickinson's signature **em-dashes** create pauses and emphases. The dash after "Death" separates clauses while maintaining connection—her dashes function like both periods and commas simultaneously.

### Chiastic Reversal
"I could not stop for Death - / He kindly stopped for me"—the syntax reverses the action:
- I could not stop for Death
- Death stopped for me

This **chiasmus** (A-B to B-A pattern) creates elegant balance and irony—death accommodates us since we cannot accommodate death.

### Exclusive Pronoun
"The Carriage held but just Ourselves"—the syntax uses "but just" (meaning "only") to limit occupants. The **first person plural "Ourselves"** capitalized suggests special intimacy, exclusivity. This is a private journey.

### Final Abstraction
"And Immortality"—this **sentence fragment** (just a noun phrase) ends the stanza. The syntax's compression is striking—Immortality rides along, no verb, no explanation. The form creates mystery through incompletion.

### Stylistic Effect
Through inverted subordination, dashes, capitalization, and fragments, Dickinson creates her signature compressed, enigmatic syntax. The form performs the content: death is both ending (dashes interrupt) and continuation (sentences don't quite end), both intimate (Ourselves) and abstract (Immortality). Syntax as paradox.
