## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison using "like" or "as."
*Example:* "lonely as a cloud"
*Effect:* Creates image of isolated wandering; makes speaker's solitude visual.

### **Relative Clause** (REL-uh-tiv klawz)
*Definition:* Subordinate clause modifying noun.
*Example:* "That floats on high o'er vales and hills"
*Effect:* Extends and elaborates the cloud simile; creates visual scene.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Substitution of associated term for thing meant.
*Example:* "crowd" and "host" for mass of flowers.
*Effect:* Personifies flowers; makes them seem social, animated.

### **Apposition** (ap-uh-ZIH-shun)
*Definition:* Placement of explanatory element beside noun.
*Example:* "A host, of golden daffodils"—"host" explains/renames "crowd"
*Effect:* Amplifies the sense of multitude through synonymous restatement.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Deliberate exaggeration.
*Example:* "all at once"—the sudden totality of the vision.
*Effect:* Emphasizes the dramatic nature of the revelation/vision.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Subject-Verb-Adverb-Simile
"I wandered lonely as a cloud"—the **simple past tense** places us in narrative past. The syntax puts "lonely" (adverb/adjective) before the simile, making the loneliness the key quality, then comparing that quality (not the person) to a cloud.

### Relative Clause Extension
"That floats on high o'er vales and hills"—the **relative pronoun "That"** extends the cloud comparison. The syntax elaborates: not just any cloud, but one floating high over valleys and hills. The verb "floats" suggests aimless drifting, continuing the loneliness theme.

The archaic contraction **"o'er"** (over) creates poetic elevation and maintains meter. The syntax through archaic form creates romantic distance.

### Temporal Subordination
"When all at once I saw"—the **subordinate temporal clause** introduced by "When" creates the turn/volta of the poem. The phrase "all at once" emphasizes suddenness—the syntax through adverbial phrase creates dramatic revelation.

### Double Apposition
"a crowd, / A host, of golden daffodils"—the syntax uses two nouns in apposition for the flowers:
- "a crowd" (first naming)
- "A host" (renaming/amplifying)

The comma between them creates pause, giving each term weight. The syntax through restatement emphasizes multitude.

The **modifier "golden"** is the only color word, making it stand out. The syntax foregrounds this one color detail through position and uniqueness.

### Stylistic Effect
Through simple past narration, elaborate simile, and carefully structured revelation, Wordsworth creates syntax of romantic epiphany. The form moves from lonely wandering (extended through relative clause) to sudden vision (marked by temporal break) to concrete beauty (specified through apposition). The syntax performs the movement from solitude to joyful discovery.
