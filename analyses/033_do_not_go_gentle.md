## Author and Source

> Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Imperative** (im-PAIR-uh-tiv)
*Definition:* Command form of verb.
*Example:* "Do not go," "Rage, rage"
*Effect:* Creates urgency and emotional intensity; directly addresses the dying.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-feh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "that good night" for death; "close of day" for end of life.
*Effect:* Softens death linguistically while rage against it intensifies emotionally.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nif-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Giving human qualities to non-human things.
*Example:* Night is "good"; day has a "close"; light is "dying."
*Effect:* Makes natural processes seem like conscious agents.

### **Epizeuxis** (ep-ih-ZOOK-sis)
*Definition:* Immediate repetition of word for emphasis.
*Example:* "Rage, rage"
*Effect:* Intensifies emotion; creates drumbeat of defiance.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Night = death; light = life; burning/raving = vital resistance.
*Effect:* Transforms abstract death into concrete images of darkness and light.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Negative Imperative
"Do not go gentle"—the syntax uses **negative command** with unusual adverb. "Gentle" normally modifies verbs ("go gently"), but Thomas uses the adjective form, creating compressed, intense syntax. The command forbids passive acceptance.

### Metaphoric Object
"into that good night"—the **prepositional phrase** uses "that" (demonstrative) as if pointing to a known entity. The adjective "good" is bitterly ironic—death isn't good, but euphemism calls it so.

### Modal Imperative
"Old age should burn and rave"—the **modal auxiliary "should"** expresses moral obligation. The **two verbs "burn and rave"** are violent, passionate—the syntax demands intensity from those usually expected to be calm.

### Temporal Euphemism
"at close of day"—another **metaphoric prepositional phrase** using time/light for life. The syntax maintains the extended metaphor: day = life, night = death.

### Repeated Imperative
"Rage, rage against the dying of the light"—the **epizeuxis** (immediate repetition) creates drumbeat effect. The syntax is pure command, no modifiers until the prepositional phrase. The gerund "dying" makes death an ongoing process that can be resisted.

### Stylistic Effect
Through imperative mood, metaphoric compression, and passionate repetition, Thomas creates syntax of defiance. The form enacts resistance to death—the commands pile up, the metaphors accumulate, the repetitions insist. This is syntax as battle cry.
