## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Synaesthesia** (sin-es-THEE-zhuh)
*Definition:* Mixing of sensory impressions.
*Example:* "drowsy numbness pains"—sleep sensation causes pain.
*Effect:* Creates paradoxical sensory experience; captures altered consciousness.

### **Allusion** (uh-LOO-zhun)
*Definition:* Reference to mythology or literature.
*Example:* "hemlock," "Lethe" (river of forgetfulness in Greek underworld)
*Effect:* Elevates personal experience to mythological significance.

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* "as though of hemlock I had drunk"
*Effect:* Compares feeling to poison/death; suggests dangerous transcendence.

### **Oxymoron** (ok-see-MOR-on)
*Definition:* Combination of contradictory terms.
*Example:* "drowsy numbness pains"
*Effect:* Captures paradox of pleasant suffering.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Statement
"My heart aches"—simple **subject-verb**, but the verb "aches" is physical pain for emotional organ. The syntax is stripped, direct.

### Coordinate Addition
"and a drowsy numbness pains / My sense"—the **coordinating conjunction** adds second sensation. The syntax creates oxymoron: numbness that pains. The **enjambment** delays "My sense," creating suspense.

### Comparative Clause
"as though of hemlock I had drunk"—the **comparative "as though"** creates simile. The syntax **inverts word order**: "of hemlock I had drunk" rather than "I had drunk hemlock." This inversion emphasizes "hemlock" and creates poetic elevation.

The **past perfect "had drunk"** suggests completed action with continuing effect.

### Compound Predicate
"Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains / One minute past"—the **alternative "Or"** offers second possibility. The verb "emptied" with object "opiate" and destination "to the drains" creates complete action.

The temporal phrase "One minute past" suggests immediacy—this just happened.

### Final Clause
"and Lethe-wards had sunk"—the **adverb "Lethe-wards"** (toward Lethe, river of forgetfulness) is Keats's coinage, using "-wards" suffix to create direction. The syntax through neologism makes mythological realm a location one can move toward.

The **past perfect "had sunk"** parallels "had drunk," suggesting completed descent.

### Stylistic Effect
Through oxymoron, mythological allusion, inverted syntax, and perfect tenses suggesting completed actions, Keats creates opening of altered consciousness. The syntax performs the drugged, drowsy state—enjambments delay, inversions disorient, and the accumulation of "had drunk...had sunk" suggests falling away from ordinary consciousness into poetic transcendence.
