# Passage 024: The Age of Innocence

## Author and Source
**Edith Wharton**, *The Age of Innocence* (1920), Chapter 1

## Passage
> On a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson was singing in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York. Though there was already talk of the erection, in remote metropolitan distances "above the Forties," of a new Opera House which should compete in costliness and splendor with those of the great European capitals, the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every winter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Periodic Sentence** (peer-ee-AH-dik SEN-tense)
*Definition:* Sentence whose main clause comes at or near the end.
*Example:* The entire second sentence suspends meaning until "the world of fashion was still content..."
*Effect:* Builds anticipation; mirrors the society's elaborate manners and delays.

### **Parenthesis** (puh-REN-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Insertion of aside or extra information.
*Example:* "in remote metropolitan distances 'above the Forties'"
*Effect:* Creates narrative voice that shares insider knowledge; establishes social geography.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition of ideas.
*Example:* "new Opera House...costliness and splendor" vs. "shabby red and gold boxes...old Academy"
*Effect:* Contrasts future pretension with present shabby comfort; suggests resistance to change.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-EK-duh-kee)
*Definition:* Part representing whole.
*Example:* "boxes" representing the wealthy theater-goers who occupy them.
*Effect:* Uses physical space to indicate social class; typical of Wharton's focus on setting/society.

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Expression of meaning through language that often signifies opposite.
*Example:* "content to reassemble...in the shabby...Academy"—they're proud of shabbiness.
*Effect:* Exposes the society's contradictions: claiming refinement while clutching tawdry past.

### **Litotes** (LIE-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement using negative.
*Example:* Implicitly—the narrator's restrained description of social pretension.
*Effect:* Creates sophisticated, knowing narrative voice; typical of Wharton's subtle satire.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Temporal-Spatial Frame
"On a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson was singing in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York"—the sentence begins with **elaborate prepositional phrase** before reaching subject and verb:

**Temporal specification:**
- "On a January evening" (seasonal but not specific date)
- "of the early seventies" (decade but not year)

This **temporal vagueness-within-precision** is characteristic—we get decade but not year, month but not date. The syntax suggests this is typical, representative, not unique.

### Geographical Layering
The sentence stacks **multiple prepositional phrases of location**:
- "in Faust" (the opera being performed)
- "at the Academy of Music" (the venue)
- "in New York" (the city)

This **syntactic layering** moves from specific (opera) to general (city), creating clear spatial context. The syntax is almost documentary in its precision.

### Proper Names
The syntax deploys three **proper nouns** immediately:
- Christine Nilsson (Swedish soprano, real historical figure)
- Faust (the opera by Gounod)
- Academy of Music (actual New York venue)

This **historical specificity** grounds the fiction in reality. The syntax through proper naming creates authenticity.

### Subject Placement
"Christine Nilsson" is the **grammatical subject**, but the sentence's true focus (through syntactic weight and placement) is the time and place. The soprano is almost incidental—what matters is WHERE and WHEN. This **syntactic subordination of individual to context** is characteristic of Wharton's social vision.

### The Concessive Opening
"Though there was already talk"—the second sentence begins with **subordinate concessive clause** introduced by "Though." This syntactic choice signals: despite X, Y happened. The sentence's main point comes much later.

This **initial subordination** creates what Tufte calls **suspended syntax**—we must wait through multiple clauses before reaching the main assertion.

### Existential Construction
"there was already talk"—this **existential "there"** construction is impersonal. The syntax doesn't say "people were talking" (active) but "there was...talk" (passive/impersonal). This creates distance, suggests gossip and rumor rather than definite plans.

The adverb **"already"** suggests prematurity or inevitability. The syntax through temporal modifier hints that change is coming, perhaps too fast.

### Nominalization
"of the erection...of a new Opera House"—the **nominalized verb** "erection" (rather than "erecting" or "building") creates formal, architectural register. The syntax elevates through latinized diction.

The phrase **"of the erection, in remote metropolitan distances"** uses nested prepositions, creating elaboration and delay. The syntax through complication mirrors the society's elaborate circumlocutions.

### Parenthetical Aside
"in remote metropolitan distances 'above the Forties'"—this phrase contains **quoted social shorthand**: "above the Forties" (above 40th Street). The syntax uses:
- Scare quotes to indicate this is insider language
- The definite article "the Forties" (like a known landmark)
- No explanation (assumes readers know or can infer)

This **parenthetical syntax** creates intimacy between narrator and reader—we're insiders together, understanding the social geography.

The oxymoronic **"remote metropolitan distances"** is characteristic Wharton—formal language for simple concept (uptown). The syntax through pompous phrasing satirizes the society's pretensions.

### Relative Clause with Modal
"which should compete in costliness and splendor"—the **relative clause** uses modal auxiliary "should" (rather than "would" or "could"), suggesting obligation, appropriateness, or intention. The syntax makes competition a moral imperative.

The **parallel abstract nouns** "costliness and splendor" are Latinate, elevated. The syntax doesn't say "expensive and beautiful" but uses more formal diction, creating ironic distance.

### Comparative Prepositional Phrase
"with those of the great European capitals"—the **prepositional phrase** provides comparison. The syntax uses:
- "those" (pronoun standing for "Opera Houses")
- "of the great European capitals" (defining the competition)

The syntax reveals social inferiority complex—New York must compete with Europe. The modifier **"great"** applied to European (not American) capitals is telling.

### Main Clause Finally
"the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every winter"—after all the subordinate material, we finally get the **main independent clause**. This is classic **periodic structure**—meaning suspended until end.

The **subject** "the world of fashion" is a beautiful **synecdoche/metonymy**. The syntax doesn't say "fashionable people" but personifies their collective as "world."

The **copulative verb** "was...content" (not active verb) emphasizes state rather than action. The syntax makes their satisfaction the point.

The adverb **"still"** is crucial—it suggests persistence, perhaps stubbornness. Despite talk of change, they remain. The syntax through single adverb indicates resistance.

### Infinitive of Purpose
"to reassemble"—the **infinitive** expresses purpose. The verb "reassemble" (re- + assemble) emphasizes this is repeated, habitual, seasonal. The syntax through verb choice indicates ritual.

### Temporal Specification
"every winter"—this **frequency phrase** indicates the pattern. The syntax emphasizes regularity, tradition, ritual repetition.

### Final Prepositional Phrase
"in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy"—this **long prepositional phrase** finally specifies the location, and it's loaded with **evaluative modifiers**:

The adjective **"shabby"** is key—this is negative (run-down) but the context suggests they're proud of it. The syntax doesn't condemn the shabbiness but presents it as fact.

The **coordinate adjectives** "red and gold" specify colors (typical of 19th-century theater décor), creating visual precision.

The phrase **"red and gold boxes"** uses **synecdoche**—"boxes" stands for "opera boxes" and also for the people who occupy them. The syntax compresses social class and physical space.

The adjective **"sociable"** applied to "old Academy" is revealing. The syntax suggests the venue facilitates social interaction—opera as social event, not artistic one.

The adjective **"old"** could be negative (outdated) but in context seems positive (traditional, familiar). The syntax makes age a virtue.

### Sentence Length Contrast
Note the dramatic difference:
- First sentence: 28 words (moderate complexity)
- Second sentence: 62 words (highly complex with multiple subordinate clauses)

This **syntactic expansion** in the second sentence mirrors its content—the elaborate world requires elaborate syntax to capture it.

### Subordination Levels
The second sentence has **multiple levels of embedding**:
- Main clause: "the world of fashion was still content to reassemble"
- Subordinate to that: "Though there was already talk"
- Subordinate to talk: "of the erection...of a new Opera House"
- Subordinate to that: "which should compete"
- Subordinate to that: "with those of the great European capitals"

This **syntactic nesting** creates what linguists call **right-branching structure**—each phrase adds more to the right, delaying closure. This is characteristic of formal, literary prose.

### Passive and Impersonal Constructions
Notice the **lack of human agency** in the syntax:
- "there was already talk" (no one specifically talking)
- "Christine Nilsson was singing" (she acts, but almost as backdrop)
- "the world of fashion was content" (collective, not individuals)

This **syntactic impersonality** reflects Wharton's vision: individuals are less important than social forces and collective behavior.

### Ironic Register
The syntax maintains **high register** (costliness, splendor, reassemble, metropolitan distances) while describing what amounts to provincial clinging to shabby past. This **gap between syntactic formality and semantic limitation** creates irony.

### Balanced Antithesis
The sentence creates **syntactic balance** between:
- New Opera House (future): "costliness and splendor," "great European capitals"
- Old Academy (present): "shabby," "red and gold boxes," "sociable old"

The syntax gives equal weight to both, but the balance reveals preference for the familiar shabby over the ambitious new.

### Definite Articles
Note the **concentration of "the"**:
- "the early seventies"
- "the erection"
- "the Forties"
- "the great European capitals"
- "the world of fashion"
- "the shabby red and gold boxes"
- "the sociable old Academy"

This **syntactic definiteness** creates a world of known entities, insider knowledge, established facts. The syntax through article choice creates exclusivity.

### Stylistic Effect
Through elaborate periodic sentences, nested subordination, and ironic juxtaposition of high register with shabby reality, Wharton creates her signature style—prose that mirrors the elaborate manners it describes while subtly satirizing them.

As Tufte emphasizes, this is **syntax as social criticism**. The delayed main clause, the elaborate specifications, the formal diction applied to provincial pretensions—all of this creates what Henry James (Wharton's friend and influence) called "the complex fate" of American society aspiring to European culture.

The syntax doesn't denounce outright but creates its critique through structure: the elaborate subordination for simple resistance to change, the formal language for shabby reality, the lengthy build-up to anti-climactic revelation (they prefer the old shabby place). This is syntax performing high-society manners—elaborate, circuitous, formal—while simultaneously revealing their limitations. Form and content work in perfect, ironic unity. The style IS the criticism.
