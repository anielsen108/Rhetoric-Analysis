# Passage 024: The Age of Innocence - Academy of Music

**Edith Wharton** · *The Age of Innocence* · 1920 | Chapter 1 (Opening setting)

**Occasion/Pressure:** Opening tableau must introduce Gilded Age New York's social codes, fusing historical detail with ironic distance.
**Persona/Stance:** Omniscient narrator with patrician wit—simultaneously insider and satirist of Old New York.
**Thesis of Effect:** Wharton engineers a chandelier-bright periodic sentence whose precise geography and delayed predicate dramatize a society addicted to ceremony yet resistant to change.

---

## PASSAGE

[L1] On a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson was singing in *Faust* at the
[L2] Academy of Music in New York. Though there was already talk of the erection, in remote
[L3] metropolitan distances "above the Forties," of a new Opera House which should compete in
[L4] costliness and splendor with those of the great European capitals, the world of fashion was
[L5] still content to reassemble every winter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee / məˈtɒnəmi)
**Lines:** L4-5
**Definition:** Substitution of attribute or associated detail for the thing itself.
**Evidence:** "the world of fashion" stands for elite society; "boxes" for the families who occupy them.
**Effect:** Depicts people through spaces, underscoring social identity as architectural possession.
**Near-miss:** Not synecdoche alone—"world" signals social sphere rather than literal globe.

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee / ˈaɪrəni)
**Lines:** L4-5
**Definition:** Expression of meaning through implied contrast between expectation and reality.
**Evidence:** Elite society "content" with "shabby" surroundings while plotting costly rival.
**Effect:** Satirizes genteel hypocrisy—pretending satisfaction with decay while coveting grandeur.
**Near-miss:** Not sarcasm; narrator maintains polite tone even as critique glints.

### **Litotes** (LAI-toh-teez / ˈlaɪtoʊtiːz)
**Lines:** L5
**Definition:** Understatement via negation or restrained phrasing.
**Evidence:** "still content" hints at reluctant acceptance; praising sociability while noting shabbiness.
**Effect:** Creates genteel restraint; narrator withholds direct scorn, letting irony bloom.
**Near-miss:** Not meiosis (simple understatement); interplay of praise and critique is key.

### **Historical Allusion** (hiss-TOR-ih-kul uh-LOO-zhun)
**Lines:** L1-4
**Definition:** Reference to real people/events to situate fiction.
**Evidence:** Christine Nilsson (actual soprano), *Faust*, geographical "above the Forties".
**Effect:** Grounds narrative in documented high society; lends archival authority.
**Near-miss:** Not mere name-dropping; choices carry connotations of European culture imported to New York.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis / ænˈtɪθəsɪs)
**Lines:** L3-5
**Definition:** Balanced juxtaposition of opposing ideas.
**Evidence:** "costliness and splendor" vs. "shabby red and gold boxes"; "remote metropolitan distances" vs. "sociable old Academy".
**Effect:** Highlights tension between aspiration and tradition; society suspended between change and comfort.
**Near-miss:** Not paradox; oppositions remain distinct, not fused.

### **Parenthesis** (puh-REN-thuh-sis / pəˈrɛnθəsɪs)
**Lines:** L3
**Definition:** Inserted aside providing supplemental information.
**Evidence:** Quoted phrase "above the Forties" inside long sentence.
**Effect:** Mimics gossiping whisper; narrator shares insider slang.
**Near-miss:** Not reported speech; marks social jargon with quotation.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Loose-then-Periodic Hybrid**
**Lines:** L1-5
**Definition:** Sentence begins with straightforward clause then extends into suspended structure culminating later.
**Evidence:** First sentence simple declarative; second delays main clause until "the world of fashion was still content".
**Effect:** Mirrors social rhythm: apparent ease masking elaborate protocol.
**Risk:** Overextension could fatigue reader; Wharton supplies vivid modifiers to sustain interest.

### **Polysyndeton** (pol-ee-SIN-duh-ton / ˌpɒliˈsɪndɪtɒn)
**Lines:** L4-5
**Definition:** Repetition of conjunctions for rhetorical effect.
**Evidence:** "costliness and splendor"; "red and gold boxes"; "sociable old" (implicit pairing).
**Effect:** Adds lushness; strings opulent descriptors like jewels.
**Risk:** Could feel ornamental; anchored by social critique.

### **Anaphoric Prepositional Piling**
**Lines:** L1-3
**Definition:** Successive prepositional phrases establishing layered context.
**Evidence:** "On a January evening... of the early seventies... in *Faust*... at the Academy... in New York".
**Effect:** Maps temporal/spatial coordinates with cartographic precision; reader enters world step by step.
**Risk:** Too many prepositions could bog down; variation of objects keeps flow.

### **Apposition** (ap-uh-ZIH-shun / ˌæpəˈzɪʃən)
**Lines:** L3-4
**Definition:** Juxtaposition of noun phrases renaming same referent.
**Evidence:** "a new Opera House which should compete..." elaborates "erection".
**Effect:** Allows narrator to unfold ambitions of project without new sentence—like gossip piling details.
**Risk:** Could clutter; relative clause clarifies intention.

### **Balance via Antimetabole Echo**
**Lines:** L4-5
**Definition:** Inversion of word order to sharpen contrast.
**Evidence:** "costliness and splendor" (future) vs. "shabby red and gold" (present) structure parallels yet reverses value orientation.
**Effect:** Syntax dramatizes seesaw between aspiration and habit.
**Risk:** Subtle; without reader attention inversion may go unnoticed—fits Wharton's understated satire.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Sociogrammatic Naming**
**Signals:** Use of proper nouns, directional slang ("above the Forties").
**Effect on stance:** Narrator demonstrates insider knowledge while critiquing exclusivity; reader becomes confidant.
**Classical kin:** Balzac's Parisian mapping; Wharton adapts to Manhattan grid.

### **Temporal Vantage Doubling**
**Signals:** "early seventies" phrase reveals narrator writing from later moment.
**Effect:** Creates retrospective irony—voice knows eventual shifts; invites reader to note obsolescence.
**Classical kin:** Thackeray's retrospective commentary.

### **Nominal Style for Social Structures**
**Signals:** Heavy nouns ("erection," "costliness," "splendor") dominate over verbs.
**Effect:** Captures society as static tableau rather than kinetic drama; syntax mirrors stiff ritual.
**Classical kin:** Henry James's social sentences; Wharton trims yet preserves density.

### **Relative Clause Hedging**
**Signals:** "which should compete" uses modal "should" to soften claim.
**Effect:** Reflects tentative ambition—society dreams but hesitates.
**Classical kin:** Victorian hypotactic politeness.

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Sentence glides with liquid consonants and cultured vowels; "Christine Nilsson" introduces lilting Scandinavian melody; "shabby red and gold" snaps with b/d/g bursts revealing tawdry texture.

**Cadence seams:** First sentence ends crisply with "New York"—downbeat establishing setting. Second sentence suspends until "was still content"—cadential release like orchestra resolving dominant to tonic.

**Alliteration:** "remote metropolitan" r/m pairing; "costliness and splendor" sibilant sheen; "sociable...still" soft s's mimic hushed gossip.

**Assonance:** Long "o" in "old"/"Gold" draws attention to aging glamour; short "i" in "Christine"/"Nilsson" adds staccato brightness.

**Rhythm:** Alternation of long clauses with clipped adjectives reproduces swirl of opera lobby conversation.

**Music argues:** Soundscape juxtaposes gilded aspiration with creaky familiarity—aural satire.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:**
- Sentence 1: simple declarative (20 words) with prepositional front-loading.
- Sentence 2: 48-word periodic construction beginning with subordinate concessive clause.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Second sentence dominated by subordination ("Though" clause) leading to single main clause; coordination limited to descriptive pairs.

**Modification choreography:**
- Prepositions stack coordinates (time → decade → opera → venue → city).
- Relative clause "which should compete" embeds social ambition.
- Adjectival string "shabby red and gold" paints with economy.

**Inversion:** Quoted "above the Forties" functions as cultural inversion—colloquial direction inside formal sentence; otherwise SVO maintained for clarity.

**Information flow:** Start with vivid present event (Nilsson singing) → rumor of future edifice → evaluation of current habit → ironic descriptor of venue. Reader moves from spectacle to socio-economic diagnosis.

### Micro-rewrites:

**Compressed:** *"In the early 1870s, society still crowded the shabby Academy of Music to hear Christine Nilsson sing *Faust*, even while plotting a grander uptown opera house."*
**Lost:** Layered irony, precise diction like "remote metropolitan distances," tone of amused authority.

**Dilated:** *"During one wintry evening in that first phase of the eighteen-seventies, while the celebrated soprano Christine Nilsson rendered Gounod's *Faust* upon the stage of New York's established Academy of Music, murmured conversations already entertained the possibility of constructing far uptown a rival opera house whose magnificence might rival Europe's, yet the fashionable set persisted in gathering annually within the timeworn scarlet-and-gilt compartments of the venerable Academy."*
**Lost:** Tight irony replaced by cumbersome clauses; satire dulls.

**Focalization shift (character interior):** *"Newland thought it absurd that everyone kept praising the shabby boxes while whispering about the new place above the Forties."*
**Effect:** Reveals bias but sacrifices panoramic narrator who can judge entire society.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Narrator speaking from later vantage (hence "early seventies"). Demonstrative "the world of fashion" assumes shared understanding.

**Aspect:** Simple past for reportage; habitual aspect implied by "every winter"—iterative tradition.

**Modality:** Modal "should compete" expresses aspiration rather than certainty; "already talk" hints at inevitability yet indefinite.

**Evidential posture:** Narrator claims insider knowledge of gossip and architectural schemes; voice assures us with aristocratic authority.

**Quoted locus:** Scare quotes "above the Forties" capture colloquial speech, signaling class-coded vocabulary.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Theatrical/architectural:** opera, boxes, house—society as staged performance.
2. **Color/texture:** "shabby red and gold" conjures faded upholstery; glamour frayed.
3. **Geographic altitude:** "above the Forties" implies both literal uptown move and social elevation.

**Lexical fields:**
- **Economics:** costliness, splendor, content.
- **Sociability:** world, reassemble, sociable.
- **Time:** January, early seventies, every winter.

**Image logic:** Spatial metaphor of rising northward equals social ambition, yet gravitational pull drags society back into worn boxes; visual contrast underscores irony.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Heterodiegetic narrator hovering above ballroom; zero focalization providing global knowledge.

**Time (Genette):**
- **Order:** Straight chronological description of evening, with foreshadowing of future opera house.
- **Duration:** Scenic detail compresses into two sentences; summary glimpses years of winter gatherings.
- **Frequency:** Iterative—"every winter" indicates repeated action.

**Beat structure:** Setting stage (time/place) → acknowledging rumor of change → evaluating actual practice → delivering ironic punch (shabby contentment).

**Subtext:** Old New York clings to rituals despite craving European legitimacy; class anxiety disguised as tradition.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Historical references and confident mapping assert narrator's authority as cultural historian.

**Pathos:** Gentle nostalgia mingled with critique; readers feel bittersweet charm of decaying splendor.

**Logos:** Logical contrast: if new house promised grandeur, why return to shabbiness? Answer implied—habit and exclusivity stronger than progress.

**Cultural argument:** Syntax contends that architecture encodes social power; by attending old Academy, elite polices boundaries under guise of tradition.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Balzac & Parisian realist tradition:** Detailed mapping of society via spaces.

**Henry James:** Polite sentences concealing razor irony; Wharton was his protégée.

**Social satire of Austen:** Use of free indirect commentary to skewer manners, though Wharton employs omniscient distance.

**Subversion:** Unlike celebratory Gilded Age chronicles, Wharton exposes stagnation, revealing aristocracy as museum piece.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots:
1. **"remote metropolitan distances 'above the Forties'"**—Captures Manhattan geography and snobbery in one stroke.
2. **"the world of fashion was still content"**—Main clause delivering judgment; adverb "still" carries centuries of inertia.
3. **"shabby red and gold boxes"**—Visual image of faded grandeur; tactile satire.

### Faultlines:
1. **Dense modifiers**—Risk overwhelming readers. Defense: precision immerses without confusion thanks to clean syntax.
2. **Cultural insider references**—May alienate uninformed readers. Defense: part of effect—exclusivity highlighted.
3. **Tone of superiority**—Narrator could seem snobbish. Defense: Irony targets elites themselves, inviting reader complicity.

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

### Subtraction test:
**Remove:** "shabby"
**Result:** Boxes regain sheen; critique softened; satire dulls.

### Amplification test:
**Add explicit judgment:** *"...revealing their hypocrisy."*
**Effect:** Heavy-handed; loses elegant restraint.

### Register shift:
**Newspaper report:** *"Society again filled the Academy of Music last night while rumors circulated of a new opera house above 40th Street."*
**Effect:** Informational but lacks ironic sparkle.

**Colloquial gossip:** *"Honey, they still cram into those worn red-and-gold boxes even while bragging about some fancy new uptown hall."*
**Effect:** Fun but erodes cultivated narrative persona.

### Punctuation swap:
**Replace comma after "erection" with dash**
**Effect:** Dash would inject breezier tone; comma keeps sentence ceremonious.

### Tense shift:
**Present tense narration**
**Effect:** Would mimic live reportage but sacrifice reflective irony of hindsight.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

### Imitatio:
*On a March night of the late nineties, Ysaye was bowing through Mendelssohn in Carnegie Hall. Though investors already murmured about a gleaming concert temple rising in Morningside Heights to rival Europe's, New York's connoisseurs still crowded the familiar velvet aisles of the venerable brownstone hall.*

**Replicates:** Temporal/spatial layering, concessive clause, irony of tradition vs. novelty.

### Counter-Imitatio:
*People said a new opera house would be nicer, but everyone kept going to the old one anyway.*

**Opposes:** Stripped diction, no layered modifiers, no irony.

### Compression (≤20 words):
*Even in the early 1870s, fashionable New Yorkers preferred the shabby Academy boxes while daydreaming about a pricier uptown opera house.*

**Keeps:** Contrast. **Loses:** Texture, wit, cadential beauty.

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. **Front-load prepositions** to usher readers through time and space elegantly.
2. **Use concessive clauses** to stage irony—"Though X, still Y" reveals contradictions.
3. **Let architecture stand in for social character.**
4. **Deploy color adjectives sparingly** to puncture glamour.
5. **Quote insider slang** to signal class boundaries while maintaining narrator authority.
6. **Balance long periodic sentences with crisp declaratives** for rhythm.
7. **Embed economic vocabulary** to expose power dynamics lurking beneath etiquette.
8. **Aim for understatement** ("still content") to sharpen satire.
