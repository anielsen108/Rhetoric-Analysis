## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Archaism** (AR-kay-iz-um)
*Definition:* Use of outdated or old-fashioned language.
*Example:* "Four score and seven years" instead of "87 years"
*Effect:* Creates Biblical tone; links American founding to sacred history.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nif-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Attribution of human qualities to non-human things.
*Example:* Nation is "conceived" and "dedicated"—birthing metaphor.
*Effect:* Makes nationhood organic, living; emphasizes its human creation.

### **Allusion** (uh-LOO-zhun)
*Definition:* Reference to other texts.
*Example:* "all men are created equal"—quotes Declaration of Independence.
*Effect:* Links Civil War to Revolutionary principles; creates continuity.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Nation as conceived child.
*Effect:* Makes abstract political entity concrete and vital.

### **Parallelism** (par-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structures.
*Example:* "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition"
*Effect:* Creates balanced, memorable phrasing.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Biblical Opening
"Four score and seven years ago"—this **temporal phrase** uses archaic measurement (score = 20 years). The syntax deliberately echoes King James Bible, giving the speech sacred resonance. Modern syntax would say "87 years ago," but Lincoln chooses elevated diction.

### Subject-Verb-Object
"our fathers brought forth...a new nation"—the **possessive "our fathers"** (not "the founders") creates familial intimacy and collective ownership. The verb phrase **"brought forth"** continues Biblical register (suggesting birth). The **object "a new nation"** receives two parallel participial modifiers.

### Parallel Participles
"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition"—two **past participles** modify "nation":
- conceived in [abstraction]
- dedicated to [abstraction]

The syntax creates the nation as both naturally born (conceived) and purposefully created (dedicated)—dual origin.

### Subordinate Noun Clause
"that all men are created equal"—this **noun clause** serves as object of "proposition." Lincoln embeds Jefferson's words syntactically, making the Declaration's principle the foundation (literally, in syntax) of the nation.

### Stylistic Effect
Through archaic diction, biblical parallelism, and embedded quotation, Lincoln creates prose that sounds both ancient and urgent. The syntax performs a key rhetorical move: presenting 1863 America as fulfillment of 1776 promises. As Tufte notes, the elaborate syntax for a single sentence mirrors the complexity of preserving the Union—this isn't simple but requires careful, balanced construction.
