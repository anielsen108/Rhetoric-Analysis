## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions between items.
*Example:* "sad-colored garments and gray, steeple-crowned hats"
*Effect:* Creates accumulation of descriptive details; emphasizes Puritan austerity.

### **Parallelism** (pair-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structures.
*Example:* "some wearing hoods, and others bareheaded"
*Effect:* Balances description; shows variety within uniformity.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-EK-duh-kee)
*Definition:* Part represents whole.
*Example:* "bearded men" and "steeple-crowned hats" represent Puritan community.
*Effect:* Condenses social identity into physical markers.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Nominal Subject
"A throng of bearded men"—**noun phrase** with **genitive modifier**. Syntax emphasizes collective over individual.

### Participial Modification
"intermixed with women"—**past participle** modifying throng. Syntax shows gender integration while maintaining male priority (men named first).

### Parallel Participial Phrases
"some wearing hoods, and others bareheaded"—**coordinate participial phrases**. Syntax creates balance through parallel construction.

### Passive Construction
"was assembled"—**passive voice** removes agency. Syntax suggests gathering as natural, inevitable.

### Cumulative Sentence
Main clause ("A throng...was assembled") followed by expanding modifications. Syntax accumulates detail, creating visual tableau before revealing architectural focus.

### Prepositional Cascade
"in front of a wooden edifice, the door of which"—**nested prepositional phrases**. Syntax zooms from crowd to building to door, directing reader's gaze.

### Relative Clause Specification
"the door of which was heavily timbered"—**formal relative clause** with passive verb. Syntax emphasizes door's fortification.

### Stylistic Effect
Through cumulative modification, participial phrases, passive construction, and prepositional nesting, Hawthorne creates syntax of detailed observation—grammar that establishes historical distance and painterly composition.
