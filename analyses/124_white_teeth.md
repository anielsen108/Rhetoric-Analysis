# Passage 124: "Multicultural London"

## Author and Source
**Zadie Smith**, *White Teeth* (2000)

## Passage
> Every moment happens twice: inside and outside, and they are two different histories.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "inside and outside"
*Effect:* Creates binary of internal/external experience.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Apparent contradiction.
*Example:* Single moment being "two different histories"
*Effect:* Challenges linear understanding of time and experience.

### **Epizeuxis** (eh-pih-ZOOK-sis)
*Definition:* Repetition.
*Example:* "two...two" (moment, histories)
*Effect:* Emphasizes duality at heart of immigrant experience.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Universal Present
"Every moment happens"—**universal quantifier** with simple present. Syntax makes observation timeless, perpetual.

### Adverbial Repetition
"twice"—**frequency adverb**. Syntax asserts doubling of experience.

### Coordinate Opposition
"inside and outside"—**two spatial adverbs** coordinated. Syntax creates binary without hierarchy.

### Copulative Identification
"they are two different histories"—**subject-copula-complement**. Syntax transforms one moment into multiple narratives.

### Adjectival Separation
"two different"—**number with quality adjective**. Syntax emphasizes not just plurality but distinction.

### Plural Abstract
"histories"—**plural form** of usually collective noun. Syntax makes history multiple, contested.

### Stylistic Effect
Through universal quantifier, adverbial doubling, coordinate spatial opposition, and plural "histories," Smith creates syntax of postcolonial consciousness—grammar that insists every moment contains multiple, irreconcilable narratives, challenging singular historical truth.
