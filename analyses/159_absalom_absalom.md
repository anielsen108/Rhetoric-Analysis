# Passage 159: Wisteria Twilight (*Absalom, Absalom!*)

**William Faulkner** · *Absalom, Absalom!* · 1936 | Chapter 1 (Rosa Coldfield's recollection)

**Occasion/Pressure:** Narrator evokes Sutpen-era summers; sentence must saturate memory with scent and atmosphere before the story of violence unfolds.
**Persona/Stance:** First-person recollection framed by omniscient narrator—lush, Southern Gothic sensibility.
**Thesis of Effect:** Copular definitions, genitive layering, and participial timing render environment as overpowering force, with father’s cigar and wisteria scent fusing into a sensual prelude to tragedy.

---

## PASSAGE

[L1] It was a summer of wisteria.
[L2] The twilight was full of it and of the smell of his father's cigar as they sat on the front gallery after supper.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for / ˈmɛtəfɔːr)
**Lines:** L1
**Evidence:** Summer equated with wisteria; season defined by flower.
**Effect:** Time period personified by scent; memory becomes botanical.

### **Synesthesia** (sin-uhs-THEE-zhuh / ˌsɪnəsˈθiːʒə)
**Lines:** L2
**Evidence:** Twilight "full" of smell.
**Effect:** Blends sight and scent, heightening sensory immersion.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAHN-uh-mee / məˈtɒnəmi)
**Lines:** L2
**Evidence:** Father's presence conveyed through cigar aroma.
**Effect:** Authority and patriarchy distilled into smoke.

### **Anaphora of Copulas**
**Lines:** L1–L2
**Evidence:** Repetition of "was" linking identity statements.
**Effect:** Creates ceremonial tone; memory delivered as definitional truth.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Genitive Chains**
**Lines:** L2
**Evidence:** "of it," "of the smell," "of his father's cigar."
**Effect:** Possession layers intensify saturation.

### **Coordination**
**Lines:** L2
**Evidence:** "full of it and of the smell…"
**Effect:** Adds secondary scent without breaking flow; accumulation.

### **Temporal Subordination**
**Lines:** L2
**Evidence:** "as they sat…"
**Effect:** Fixes sensory experience within domestic ritual.

### **Prepositional Anchoring**
**Lines:** L2
**Evidence:** "on the front gallery" / "after supper."
**Effect:** Places memory in specific Southern space and schedule.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Copular Definition**
**Signals:** "It was…" structures.
**Effect:** Rather than describe, narrator declares essence; memory feels immutable.

### **Pronoun Saturation**
**Signals:** "it" standing in for wisteria.
**Effect:** Flower so dominant it need not be named repeatedly; pronoun suffices.

### **Participial Timing**
**Signals:** "as they sat."
**Effect:** Present action (sitting) enveloped by sensory field; human motion secondary.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Liquid w-s sounds (wisteria, was) evoke languor; hard g in "gallery" grounds scene.

**Cadence seams:** Period between L1 and L2 acts like inhale/exhale; L2's commas mimic slow rocking on porch.

**Alliteration:** "front gallery" and "father's" create soft f/g interplay.

**Music argues:** Slow, humid rhythm reinforces heavy Southern evening.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Definition sentence + cumulative sentence.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** None; statements begin with copula.
- **Mid:** Genitive phrase inserted between subject and predicate.
- **Postposed:** Temporal clause + locative phrases finalize scene.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** One coordination, one subordinate clause; otherwise declarative.

**Information flow:** Naming season → saturating twilight → adding paternal scent → situating bodies.

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"It was a wisteria summer. Twilight smelled of it and of his father's cigar while they sat on the porch after supper."* — Keeps content, less musical.
- **Dilated:** *"That summer belonged to wisteria; the twilight brimmed with its perfume and with the smoke of his father's cigar while they lingered on the front gallery once supper was done."* — Maintains lushness but adds explicit verbs.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Narrator references "they" (past family) from present vantage.

**Aspect:** Simple past describes habitual scene; subordinate clause implies iterative evenings.

**Modality:** None; statements factual, confident.

**Temporal logic:** Post-supper twilight during a particular summer; cyclical domestic routine.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Botanical dominance:** Wisteria as season.
2. **Domestic ritual:** Porch sitting, cigar.
3. **Sensory fullness:** Twilight as vessel.

**Lexical fields:** Scent, family, Southern architecture.

**Image logic:** Environment envelops characters; nature + patriarchal smoke define memory.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Rosa Coldfield recollection filtered by narratorial voice.

**Time:** Sets stage for story; this sensory prologue foreshadows decay.

**Beat structure:** Name summer → describe twilight → introduce father via scent → locate family on gallery.

**Subtext:** Wisteria beauty conceals underlying rot; paternal presence already haunting.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Author establishes authority through rich sensory recall.

**Pathos:** Scent-laden memory evokes nostalgia tinged with unease.

**Logos:** Sequence explains why wisteria and cigar define summer—because they saturate twilight while family gathers.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Southern Gothic:** Lush floral imagery akin to Tennessee Williams.

**Modernist memory:** Similar to Proustian emphasis on sensory triggers.

**Faulknerian circularity:** Recurring motifs (gallery, father) anchor sprawling narrative.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"summer of wisteria"** — declarative redefinition.
2. **"full of it"** — pronoun-saturated atmosphere.
3. **"smell of his father's cigar"** — introduces patriarchy via scent.

### Faultlines
1. **Ambiguity of "it"** relies on prior clause; careful staging needed.
2. **Idealization vs. critique:** Lushness may mask oppressive context; subsequent narrative complicates.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove cigar clause—scene loses paternal shadow.

**Amplification test:** Add "and honeysuckle"—more scent but dilutes wisteria's dominance.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"It was a season belonging to wisteria."*
- **Colloquial:** *"That summer was all wisteria."*

**Punctuation swap:** Replace comma before "as they sat" with dash—would dramatize but disrupt flow.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *It was a winter of woodsmoke. The dusk was filled with it and with the creak of Mother’s rocking chair as we huddled by the stove after chores.*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *That summer had wisteria. The twilight smelled like flowers and his father's cigar on the porch.* — Flat.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *It was a summer of wisteria; twilight brimmed with it and with his father's cigar as they sat on the front gallery after supper.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Define a season via single sensory detail to set tone.
2. Use pronouns to suggest overpowering presence without repetition.
3. Layer genitives to thicken atmosphere.
4. Anchor sensory field with domestic posture (sitting on gallery).
5. Introduce characters indirectly via smell to foreshadow influence.
6. Balance short definitional sentence with longer cumulative one.
7. Keep time marker (after supper) to ground nostalgia in routine.
