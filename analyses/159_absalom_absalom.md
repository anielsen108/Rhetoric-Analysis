# Passage 159: "Absalom, Absalom!"

## Author and Source
**William Faulkner**, *Absalom, Absalom!* (1936)

## Passage
> It was a summer of wisteria. The twilight was full of it and of the smell of his father's cigar as they sat on the front gallery after supper.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Summer "of wisteria" - possessive making flower define season.
*Effect:* Makes botanical presence into temporal quality.

### **Synesthesia** (sin-es-THEE-zhuh)
*Definition:* Mixing sensory modes.
*Example:* Twilight "full of" wisteria (visual) and smell (olfactory).
*Effect:* Blends sight and scent into unified sensory memory.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Associated term for thing.
*Example:* "cigar" for father's presence/authority.
*Effect:* Makes father into sensory marker.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Copulative Definition
"It was a summer of wisteria"—**existential copula** with genitive. Syntax makes season possess single quality.

### Genitive Characterization
"of wisteria"—**genitive preposition** defining summer. Syntax makes flower the summer's essence.

### Copulative Fullness
"The twilight was full of it"—**subject-copula-complement** with pronoun. Syntax shows atmospheric saturation.

### Pronoun Reference
"it"—**pronoun** referring to wisteria. Syntax makes flower so dominant it needs no naming.

### Coordinated Smells
"and of the smell of his father's cigar"—**coordinated genitive** adding second sensory element. Syntax layers olfactory memories.

### Nested Genitives
"the smell of his father's cigar"—**two genitive constructions**. Syntax nests possession within possession.

### Temporal Subordinate
"as they sat"—**temporal conjunction** with simple past. Syntax makes sitting simultaneous with sensory fullness.

### Locative Specification
"on the front gallery after supper"—**two prepositional phrases** of place and time. Syntax anchors memory in specific domestic ritual.

### Stylistic Effect
Through summer possessed-by-wisteria, twilight full of pronominally dominant flower, coordinated smell of father's cigar, nested genitives, temporal sitting, and specific gallery-after-supper location, Faulkner creates syntax of nostalgic recall—grammar that makes memory primarily sensory, where identity of actors matters less than atmospheric fullness of botanical and tobacco scents.
