# Passage 077: "Musée des Beaux Arts"

## Author and Source
**W.H. Auden**, *Another Time* (1940)

## Passage
> About suffering they were never wrong,
> The Old Masters

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Inversion** (in-VER-zhun)
*Definition:* Reversal of normal word order.
*Example:* "About suffering they were never wrong" instead of "They were never wrong about suffering"
*Effect:* Emphasizes "suffering" by fronting prepositional phrase.

### **Litotes** (LIE-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "never wrong" instead of "always right"
*Effect:* Creates measured, modest tone for strong claim.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Prepositional Opening
"About suffering"—**prepositional phrase** fronted before subject creates emphasis through inversion. Topic (suffering) precedes claim.

### Negative Construction  
"never wrong"—**double negative morphology** (never + wrong) creates emphatic positive. Syntax through negation paradoxically asserts certainty.

### Fragment Effect
"The Old Masters"—**noun phrase** standing as sentence or fragment. Creates pause, emphasis on who "they" are.

### Stylistic Effect
Through inversion, litotes, and fragmentary syntax, Auden creates conversational profundity—syntax that sounds casual while making absolute claims about art and suffering.
