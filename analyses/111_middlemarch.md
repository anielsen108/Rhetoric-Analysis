# Passage 111: "Miss Brooke"

## Author and Source
**George Eliot**, *Middlemarch* (1871-72)

## Passage
> Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress. Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Apparent contradiction.
*Example:* Beauty "thrown into relief by poor dress"
*Effect:* Reveals Dorothea's unconscious asceticism.

### **Allusion** (uh-LOO-zhun)
*Definition:* Reference to other work.
*Example:* "Blessed Virgin...Italian painters"
*Effect:* Elevates Dorothea to religious/artistic ideal.

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* Sleeves compared to those of Virgin Mary.
*Effect:* Sanctifies Dorothea's plainness.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Demonstrative Specification
"that kind of beauty which"—**demonstrative with relative clause**. Syntax creates category for paradoxical beauty.

### Passive Metaphor
"seems to be thrown into relief"—**passive construction** with artistic metaphor. Syntax removes Dorothea's agency in her beauty.

### Prepositional Cause
"by poor dress"—**prepositional phrase** of means. Syntax makes simplicity the instrument of beauty.

### Comparative Result Clause
"so finely formed that she could wear"—**correlative comparative** with result clause. Syntax links natural beauty to possibility.

### Negative Comparison
"not less bare of style than"—**litotes in comparative**. Syntax uses double negative to equate plainness.

### Relative Clause with Past Tense
"in which the Blessed Virgin appeared"—**defining relative** with simple past. Syntax makes art historical precedent.

### Prepositional Specification
"to Italian painters"—**indirect object**. Syntax specifies artistic tradition.

### Stylistic Effect
Through paradoxical construction (beauty by plainness), passive throwing into relief, comparative result linking form to possibility, and religious-artistic allusion, Eliot creates syntax of idealizing narration—grammar that elevates prosaic subject through high cultural reference.
