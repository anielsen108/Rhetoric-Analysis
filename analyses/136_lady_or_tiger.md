## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Rhetorical Question** (rih-TOR-ih-kul KWES-chun)
*Definition:* Question not requiring or permitting answer.
*Example:* The entire final sentence.
*Effect:* Transfers narrative resolution to reader; makes ending永 ambiguous.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "the lady, or the tiger"
*Effect:* Creates binary choice representing love vs. jealousy.

### **Apostrophe** (uh-PAH-struh-fee)
*Definition:* Direct address.
*Example:* "I leave it with all of you"
*Effect:* Breaks fourth wall; makes reader complicit in story.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Coordinating Introduction
"And so"—**coordinating conjunction with adverb**. Syntax signals conclusion while introducing question.

### First Person Declaration
"I leave it"—**subject-verb-object**. Syntax makes narrator's abdication explicit.

### Prepositional Delegation
"with all of you"—**prepositional phrase** addressing readers. Syntax transfers authority from narrator to audience.

### Embedded Question
"Which came out"—**interrogative clause** as object. Syntax embeds the central question.

### Genitive Specification
"of the opened door"—**prepositional phrase** with passive participle. Syntax emphasizes the moment of revelation.

### Disjunctive Choice
"the lady, or the tiger"—**two noun phrases** separated by disjunctive. Syntax presents mutually exclusive outcomes.

### Final Question Mark
Punctuation leaves resolution suspended. Syntax refuses closure.

### Stylistic Effect
Through coordinating conclusion that opens rather than closes, first-person abdication, prepositional transfer to audience, embedded interrogative, and final unresolved disjunction, Stockton creates syntax of deliberate inconclusiveness—grammar that performs narrative's refusal to resolve, making reader the ultimate arbiter.
