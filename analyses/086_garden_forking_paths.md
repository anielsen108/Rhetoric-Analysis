# Passage 086: "The Garden of Forking Paths"

## Author and Source
**Jorge Luis Borges**, *Ficciones* (1941)

## Passage
> I thought of a labyrinth of labyrinths, of one sinuous spreading labyrinth that would encompass the past and the future and in some way involve the stars.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of phrases.
*Example:* "of a labyrinth...of one...of labyrinths"
*Effect:* Creates recursive structure mirroring labyrinth concept.

### **Pleonasm** (PLEE-uh-naz-um)
*Definition:* Use of more words than necessary.
*Example:* "labyrinth of labyrinths...one sinuous spreading labyrinth"
*Effect:* Proliferates meanings; enacts multiplication of possibilities.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* Labyrinth encompassing past, future, and stars.
*Effect:* Makes maze cosmic, infinite.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Genitive Recursion
"a labyrinth of labyrinths"—**genitive construction** that recurses into itself. Syntax performs infinite regress.

### Appositive Expansion
"of one sinuous spreading labyrinth"—**appositive phrase** that restates and expands first labyrinth. Syntax multiplies the concept.

### Relative Clause Purpose
"that would encompass"—**relative clause with modal** expressing hypothetical. Syntax makes this imagined, not actual labyrinth.

### Coordinate Objects
"the past and the future"—**two objects of encompass** representing temporal totality. Syntax spans all time.

### Manner Phrase
"in some way involve the stars"—**prepositional phrase** with vague adjective "some." Syntax admits mystery while asserting cosmic scope.

### Stylistic Effect
Through recursive genitives, expanding appositives, and modal hypotheticals, Borges creates syntax of infinite possibility—grammar that performs the branching, multiplying structure of the labyrinth itself.
