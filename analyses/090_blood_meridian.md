# Passage 090: "Blood Meridian"

## Author and Source
**Cormac McCarthy**, *Blood Meridian* (1985)

## Passage
> They rode on. They rode like men invested with a purpose whose origins were antique and diffuse and the wholes thereof were scattered like paper in the wind.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* "rode like men invested with a purpose"; "scattered like paper"
*Effect:* Creates biblical tone while emphasizing fragmentation.

### **Polysyndeton** (pah-lee-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Many conjunctions.
*Example:* "antique and diffuse and the wholes"
*Effect:* Creates archaic, biblical rhythm; accumulates qualities.

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh)
*Definition:* One verb governing multiple objects differently.
*Example:* Origins were "antique and diffuse" (adjectives) joined with "wholes...were scattered" (different construction).
*Effect:* Creates syntactic complexity matching conceptual abstraction.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Paratactic Repetition
"They rode on. They rode like"—**two sentences with repeated subject-verb**. Syntax creates biblical cadence through repetition.

### Participial Modification
"men invested with a purpose"—**past participle** modifying men. Syntax makes purpose something bestowed upon them, not chosen.

### Relative Clause Complexity
"whose origins were antique and diffuse"—**relative clause** with compound predicate adjective. Syntax creates mystery about purpose's source.

### Abstract Plural
"the wholes thereof"—**archaic genitive** "thereof" with abstract noun. Syntax is deliberately biblical, elevated.

### Passive Participle in Simile
"scattered like paper in the wind"—**past participle** in comparison. Syntax makes purposeful riders paradoxically scattered, directionless.

### Stylistic Effect
Through paratactic repetition, participial investment, archaic genitives, and contradictory similes (purposeful yet scattered), McCarthy creates syntax of apocalyptic violence—biblical grammar for meaningless brutality.
