## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "With...with...with"
*Effect:* Creates rhythmic accumulation of principles.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "malice toward none...charity for all"
*Effect:* Establishes moral framework through contrasting pairs.

### **Parallelism** (par-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structures.
*Example:* Three "with" phrases in succession.
*Effect:* Creates formal, elevated rhetoric.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Triple Prepositional Opening
"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right"—three **parallel prepositional phrases** beginning with "with," each specifying an attitude or principle.

### Subordinate Qualification
"as God gives us to see the right"—**subordinate clause** qualifying "firmness in the right." The syntax acknowledges human fallibility even while asserting moral certainty.

### Cohortative Imperative
"let us strive on"—**first person plural imperative**. Syntax includes speaker in command, making this collective call to action.

### Infinitive of Purpose
"to finish the work we are in"—**infinitive phrase** expressing goal. The relative clause "we are in" suggests ongoing work, not yet complete.

### Stylistic Effect
Through triple anaphora, moral antithesis, and qualified assertion, Lincoln creates syntax of reconciliation. Form IS the healing—grammar that balances opposites, qualifies certainty, and unites through inclusive imperative.
