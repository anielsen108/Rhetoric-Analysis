## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Inversion** (in-VER-zhun)
*Definition:* Reversal of normal word order.
*Example:* "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan...decree" instead of "Kubla Khan decreed"
*Effect:* Creates archaic, epic tone; emphasizes location.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* "caverns measureless to man"
*Effect:* Creates supernatural scale; makes geography mythic.

### **Alliteration** (uh-lit-uh-RAY-shun)
*Definition:* Repetition of initial sounds.
*Example:* "Kubla Khan"; "pleasure...decree"
*Effect:* Creates musical, incantatory quality.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Inverted Syntax
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan...decree"—**auxiliary "did"** placed between subject and verb creates archaic question-like inversion though this is declarative. Emphasizes place (Xanadu) by fronting prepositional phrase.

### Object-Subject-Verb Order
Normal order: "Kubla Khan decreed a stately pleasure-dome in Xanadu." Coleridge's syntax: place-auxiliary-subject-object-verb. This **radical inversion** creates epic formality.

### Compound Adjective
"stately pleasure-dome"—**two modifiers** before noun create specific architectural vision. "Pleasure-dome" itself is **compound noun** suggesting purpose-built structure for enjoyment.

### Relative Clause
"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran"—**subordinate clause** specifies location. The **appositive** "the sacred river" renames Alph with elevated modifier.

### Prepositional Phrase of Motion
"Through caverns measureless to man"—describes river's path. The **adjective phrase "measureless to man"** suggests limits of human comprehension.

### Stylistic Effect
Through radical inversion, archaic syntax, and accumulating exotic details, Coleridge creates dream-vision. Form IS the opium dream—syntax that doesn't follow normal rules, creating otherworldly effect.
