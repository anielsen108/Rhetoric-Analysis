# Passage 088: "Midnight's Children"

## Author and Source
**Salman Rushdie**, *Midnight's Children* (1981)

## Passage
> I was born in the city of Bombay...once upon a time. No, that won't do, there's no getting away from the date: I was born in Doctor Narlikar's Nursing Home on August 15th, 1947. And the time? The time matters, too.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Aposiopesis** (a-pah-sigh-oh-PEE-sis)
*Definition:* Breaking off mid-sentence.
*Example:* "once upon a time. No, that won't do"
*Effect:* Rejects fairy tale convention; emphasizes historical specificity.

### **Correctio** (kor-REK-tee-oh)
*Definition:* Self-correction.
*Example:* Narrator corrects himself about the date.
*Effect:* Makes narration self-conscious; emphasizes precision.

### **Epistrophe** (ee-PIS-truh-fee)
*Definition:* Repetition at end of clauses.
*Example:* "The time? The time matters, too."
*Effect:* Emphasizes significance of exact moment of birth.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Passive Birth Construction
"I was born"—**passive voice** twice repeated. Syntax emphasizes being acted upon, coming into being at specific moment.

### Fairy Tale Opening Rejected
"once upon a time. No, that won't do"—**sentence fragment** followed by **explicit rejection**. Syntax performs rejection of timeless narrative.

### Emphatic Negation
"there's no getting away from the date"—**gerund with negative existential**. Syntax insists on historical anchoring.

### Precision Through Accumulation
"in Doctor Narlikar's Nursing Home on August 15th, 1947"—**three prepositional phrases** specifying location and exact date. Syntax accumulates specificity.

### Rhetorical Question and Answer
"And the time? The time matters, too."—**interrogative followed by declarative**. Syntax asks and answers its own question, emphasizing temporal precision.

### Stylistic Effect
Through self-correction, rejected fairy tale opening, and insistent precision about date and time, Rushdie creates syntax of historical consciousness—grammar that binds personal narrative to India's birth as nation at midnight of independence.
