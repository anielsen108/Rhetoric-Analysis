## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of successive clauses.
*Example:* "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow"
*Effect:* Creates monotonous, defeated rhythm; suggests endless, meaningless repetition.

### **Polysyndeton** (pol-ee-SIN-duh-ton)
*Definition:* Use of multiple conjunctions.
*Example:* "and tomorrow, and tomorrow"
*Effect:* Slows pace; makes time feel heavy, dragging, oppressive.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nif-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Attribution of human qualities to non-human things.
*Example:* Tomorrow "creeps"; yesterdays "have lighted"
*Effect:* Makes time an active, almost malevolent agent.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Time as a slow-moving creature; life as recorded text; death as dusty destination.
*Effect:* Transforms abstract time into visceral experience of futility.

### **Transferred Epithet** (trans-FERD EP-ih-thet)
*Definition:* Adjective logically belonging to one noun applied to another.
*Example:* "petty pace"—the pace itself isn't petty, but life/time is.
*Effect:* Infects all of existence with Macbeth's nihilism.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Triple Repetition
"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow"—the **three-fold repetition** with polysyndeton creates what Tufte calls syntactic monotony-as-meaning. The form IS the futility.

### Present Tense Verb
"Creeps"—shifts from future (tomorrow) to **present tense**, suggesting all time creeps, always. The verb choice "creeps" (not "moves" or "goes") emphasizes slowness, stealthiness, something unpleasant.

### Prepositional Phrase Chain
"in this petty pace from day to day"—**stacked prepositional phrases** create the sense of being trapped in syntactic structure itself, moving from one preposition to another with no escape.

### Infinitive of Destination
"To the last syllable of recorded time"—the **infinitive of purpose/destination** suggests this is where time goes: to ending, to silence (last syllable), to the end of the text/record of existence.

The metaphor of "syllable of recorded time" makes life textual—we're words in a book reaching the last syllable, then silence.

### Coordinating Turn
"And all our yesterdays"—the **coordinating conjunction** shifts from future (tomorrows) to past (yesterdays), suggesting time surrounds us from both directions.

### Perfect Tense
"have lighted"—the **present perfect** connects past action to present consequence. The past has created our current situation: leading to death.

### Object and Destination
"lighted fools / The way to dusty death"—the syntax makes "fools" the object (we are the fools) and "way to dusty death" the destination. The adjective "dusty" makes death not glorious but dirty, dry, crumbling.

### Stylistic Effect
Through anaphoric repetition, polysyndeton, and tense shifts, Shakespeare creates syntax of nihilistic despair. The form performs Macbeth's state: the repeated tomorrows that go nowhere, the slow creep of meaningless time, the syntax itself trapped in repetitive structures. This is grammar as existential crisis.
