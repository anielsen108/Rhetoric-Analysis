# Passage 144: "The Call of the Wild"

## Author and Source
**Jack London**, *The Call of the Wild* (1903)

## Passage
> He was sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb of Time.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Nature as ocean with "deeps"; Time as "womb"
*Effect:* Makes psychological regression into spatial/temporal journey.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Time as maternal figure with womb.
*Effect:* Makes history biological, generative.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Seeming contradiction.
*Example:* Parts of nature "deeper than he"
*Effect:* Suggests unconscious exceeds conscious self.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Progressive Action
"was sounding"—**past progressive**. Syntax shows ongoing exploration.

### Nautical Metaphor
"sounding the deeps"—**verb from navigation**. Syntax makes psychological exploration into oceanic depth-finding.

### Genitive Possession
"of his nature"—**possessive genitive**. Syntax claims ownership of what paradoxically exceeds him.

### Coordinate Genitives
"of his nature, and of the parts"—**two parallel genitives**. Syntax doubles the object of exploration.

### Relative Clause Comparison
"that were deeper than he"—**comparative construction** in relative clause. Syntax measures unconscious against conscious self.

### Participial Regression
"going back"—**present participle** showing direction. Syntax makes sounding also a journey.

### Prepositional Destination
"into the womb of Time"—**spatial preposition** with biological metaphor. Syntax makes temporal regression spatial and maternal.

### Capital Personification
"Time"—**capitalized abstract noun**. Syntax elevates time to deity or cosmic force.

### Stylistic Effect
Through progressive sounding, nautical/oceanic depth metaphor, comparative paradox (parts deeper than whole), participial backward journey, and capitalized maternal Time, London creates syntax of atavistic regression—grammar that performs Buck's descent into racial memory through spatial metaphors of oceanic depth and uterine return.
