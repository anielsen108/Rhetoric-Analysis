# Passage 105: "I Sing the Body Electric" (Full Opening)

**Walt Whitman** · *Leaves of Grass* · 1855 | "I Sing the Body Electric" (lines 1-4)

**Occasion/Pressure:** Whitman widens the democratic hymn to celebrate corporeal holiness; opening must sanctify the body without slipping into prudery or vulgarity.
**Persona/Stance:** Evangelical yet tender bard, speaking as both lover and priest of the human form.
**Thesis of Effect:** Syntax electrifies flesh by looping neologisms, reciprocity, and accumulative purpose clauses so the body feels charged with communal spirit.

## PASSAGE

[L1] I sing the body electric,
[L2] The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them,
[L3] They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,
[L4] And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Neologism** (NEE-oh-loh-jiz-um / niːˈɒlədʒɪzəm)
**Lines:** L2, L4
**Definition:** Newly minted word or usage.
**Evidence:** "engirth" and "discorrupt" coin verbs from noun/adjective roots.
**Effect:** Inventive lexicon implies that democracy requires new grammar; body reverence demands fresh language.
**Near-miss:** Not simple derivation; these forms had no prior attestation—Whitman forces acceptance.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for / ˈmɛtəfɔːr)
**Lines:** L1, L4
**Definition:** Implicit comparison.
**Evidence:** Body likened to electrical apparatus charged by soul.
**Effect:** Fuses scientific modernity with spiritual awe, re-enchanting physicality.
**Near-miss:** Not simile—no "like" or "as" draws explicit comparison.

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus / kaɪˈæzməs)
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Inverted grammatical structure.
**Evidence:** "those I love" (object → subject) mirrored by "I engirth them" (subject → object reversed).
**Effect:** Syntax wraps lovers around each other, enacting mutual embrace.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh / əˈnæfərə)
**Lines:** L3–L4
**Definition:** Repetition at clause openings.
**Evidence:** Consecutive infinitives introduced by implied "to"; explicit "And" begins L4.
**Effect:** Rolling obligations underscore unstoppable compassion.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Polysyndeton** (PAH-lee-SIN-duh-ton / ˌpɒlɪˈsɪndətɒn)
**Lines:** L2–L4
**Definition:** Multiple conjunctions in quick succession.
**Evidence:** "and" links engirth clauses; L4 adds twin "and" entries.
**Effect:** Builds breathless solidarity, as if each link is another body joining the circle.

### **Asyndetic Opening → Syndetic Cascade**
**Lines:** L1–L4
**Definition:** Move from omission of conjunctions to abundance.
**Evidence:** L1 stands alone; subsequent lines flood with connectors.
**Effect:** Solo "I" becomes communal "and," dramatizing expansion from singular voice to collective choir.

### **Gradatio** (gruh-DAY-shee-oh / ɡrəˈdeɪʃiˌoʊ)
**Lines:** L2–L4
**Definition:** Successive clauses build by repeating element from previous clause.
**Evidence:** "engirth me" → "I engirth them"; "go with them" → "respond to them" → "discorrupt them" → "charge them."
**Effect:** Creates ladder of obligation, ascending from physical closeness to spiritual renewal.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Reciprocal Reflexive Looping**
**Signals:** Reflexive "engirth" structure sharing object/subject roles.
**Effect on stance:** Everyone is simultaneously subject and object of embrace; pronouns dissolve hierarchy.
**Classical kin:** Mutual middle voice from Greek; grammatical democracy.

### **Cumulative Infinitive Chain**
**Signals:** Series of bare infinitives (go, respond, discorrupt, charge) after "till."
**Effect:** Obligations accumulate, showing ethical inevitability; syntax equals contract.
**Classical kin:** Latin infinitive cascades in Cicero, but Whitman retains vernacular energy.

### **Self-Pairing Lexical Echo**
**Signals:** "charge…charge" repeats noun/verb pair.
**Effect:** Morphology recycles itself, implying energy circuit closing.
**Classical kin:** Figures of polyptoton in rhetoric.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Hard g's (sing, engirth) crackle like sparks; liquid l's (electric, love) soften impact.

**Cadence seams:** L1 ends with enjambed comma; lines cascade without full stop, mimicking uninterrupted current.

**Sound clusters:** Repeated long o in "soul" resonates with "full," suggesting resonance chamber; "charge" / "charge" double beat emphasises voltage.

**Music argues:** Sonic oscillation between plosives and liquids enacts charge surging through flesh.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Single loose sentence subdivided by commas, operating as breath-unit more than clause-unit.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** None—poem leaps directly into predicate, telegraphing urgency.
- **Mid:** Relative phrase "of those I love" nestles inside L2, expanding noun "armies." 
- **Postposed:** Infinitive ladder extends obligation outward.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Heavy coordination (and/and) balancing one subordinate temporal clause ("till").

**Information flow:** Declaration of purpose → description of lovers → condition of obligation → mission of purification.

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"I sing the electric body; those I love surround me till I go, respond, cleanse, and charge them with soul."* — Gains clarity but loses Whitman's invented lexicon.
- **Dilated:** *"I intone the sanctified body electric, for the multitudes dear to me encircle me even as I enclose them, refusing to release me until I accompany, answer, rehabilitate, and saturate them with the soul's galvanic force."* — Achieves rhetorical lushness yet forfeits direct chant.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Present-tense "I" and immediate "them" set scene in continual now; no spatial coordinates beyond encirclement.

**Aspect:** Simple present + future modal "will not" indicate ongoing condition with implicit future action.

**Modality:** "will not let me" expresses deontic compulsion from beloved community; not speaker's choice.

**Temporal logic:** "till" projects future compliance; the poem's mission is to close that temporal gap.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Electrical:** body as charged conductor, soul as energy.
2. **Military/collective:** "armies" refigures intimacy as disciplined yet loving force.

**Lexical fields:** Words of embrace (engirth) meet moral purification (discorrupt) and energy (charge).

**Image logic:** Physical closeness leads to moral/spiritual renewal; electricity becomes sacrament.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** First-person voice addressing implicit collective; interior vow with external audience listening.

**Time:** Present action compelled by future mission; narrative tension resides in whether he will fulfill obligations.

**Beat structure:** Declaration → mutual embrace → community pressure → promise of redemption.

**Subtext:** The poet positions himself both servant and savior; democratic erotics fused with pastoral duty.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Whitman's willingness to be bound by beloved "armies" proves his loyalty; neologisms display creative authority.

**Pathos:** Language of encirclement and charging conjures tactile intimacy and hope for cleansing.

**Logos:** Causal chain: because they encircle him, he must accompany, respond, heal, energize them—ethical syllogism.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Transcendental inheritance:** Emersonian body-spirit unity, but Whitman electrifies it with scientific imagery.

**Biblical mission:** Echoes prophetic calling narratives where community compels speaker (cf. Jeremiah's fire in bones).

**Technological modernity:** Early telegraph/electric fascination repurposed for humanistic theology.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"body electric"** — Shocks Victorian sensibilities by sanctifying flesh with technology.
2. **"The armies of those I love"** — Oxymoronic fusion of militaristic mass and tender affection.
3. **"charge them full"** — Doubling of "charge" welds physical and spiritual tasks.

### Faultlines
1. **Neologism opacity:** "discorrupt" may puzzle. **Revision test:** replace with "cleanse"—clearer but loses radical energy.
2. **Potential coercion:** "will not let me off" suggests lack of agency. **Revision test:** swap for "beg me to" to soften; but then sense of ethical duty weakens.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove "The armies of those I love"—result: solitary mission lacking communal reciprocity.

**Amplification test:** Extend list beyond four infinitives—risk of rhetorical bloat but could mimic endless service.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"I hymn the corporeal electric; the cohorts dear to me encompass me and I them, refusing discharge until I accompany, reply, re-purify, and endow them with the soul's puissance."*
- **Colloquial:** *"I'm singing the livewire body; my people wrap around me like a squad and won't quit until I roll with them, answer them, un-gunk them, and juice them with the soul."*

**Punctuation swap:** Replace commas with semicolons; effect = bureaucratic, slower current. Original commas keep voltage humming.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *I praise the breathing circuit; the beloved ranks clasp me and I clasp them, unwilling to release me until I walk with, answer, cleanse, and flood them with spirit-spark.*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *The body is important. People I like surround me. I should accompany and help them.* — Flat reportage, no energy or invention.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *I sing the body electric; loved armies clasp me till I go, respond, discorrupt, and charge them with the soul's current.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Coin verbs when English lacks the charge you need.
2. Let reciprocity structures (subject/object flip) embody mutuality.
3. Balance one solitary declaration with cascades of communal "and." 
4. Tie sensory body language to technological metaphor to modernize awe.
5. Use infinitive chains to show ethical duties piling up.
6. Repeat key nouns as verb + noun pair to simulate closed circuit.
7. Make community pressure the reason your speaker acts—ethos through obligation.
