## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "I sing...I love...I engirth"
*Effect:* Creates prophetic, bardic voice.

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus)
*Definition:* Inverted parallel.
*Example:* "I engirth them...they...engirth me"
*Effect:* Shows mutual encompassing, reciprocal love.

### **Neologism** (nee-AH-luh-jiz-um)
*Definition:* Invented word.
*Example:* "engirth," "discorrupt"
*Effect:* Creates new language for new democratic vision.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Body as "electric" - charged with energy.
*Effect:* Makes physical body site of spiritual electricity.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Declarative Opening
"I sing"—**simple subject-verb**. Syntax announces bardic role with epic simplicity.

### Object as Oxymoron
"the body electric"—**noun modified by scientific adjective**. Syntax fuses physical and energetic.

### Plural Genitive
"The armies of those I love"—**military metaphor** with first-person relative clause. Syntax makes loved ones into multitudes.

### Reciprocal Verb
"engirth me and I engirth them"—**coordinate clauses** with repeated neologism. Syntax performs mutual encircling.

### Negative Permission
"They will not let me off"—**future tense with negative**. Syntax shows compulsion of love.

### Purpose Clause Series
"till I go...respond...And discorrupt...and charge"—**four purpose clauses**. Syntax accumulates poet's obligations.

### Final Metaphoric Clause
"charge them full with the charge of the soul"—**transitive verb** with **genitive object** using same root word. Syntax plays on electrical charging and spiritual responsibility.

### Stylistic Effect
Through bardic declaration, neologistic invention, reciprocal syntax, and accumulating purpose clauses, Whitman creates grammar of democratic prophecy—syntax that charges the body with spiritual electricity.
