# Passage 056: "The Second Coming"

## Author and Source
**William Butler Yeats**, *The Dial* (1920)

## Passage
> Turning and turning in the widening gyre
> The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
> Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
> Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "The falcon cannot...the centre cannot"
*Effect:* Creates parallel structure emphasizing multiple failures.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Falcon/falconer for social order; gyre for historical cycles.
*Effect:* Makes abstract historical forces concrete and visual.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nif-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Attribution of human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* "Things fall apart"; "anarchy is loosed"
*Effect:* Makes historical forces active agents.

### **Apocalyptic Imagery** (uh-pok-uh-LIP-tik IM-ij-ree)
*Definition:* Language of end times.
*Example:* Centre cannot hold, anarchy loosed.
*Effect:* Creates sense of civilization's collapse.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Present Participle Opening
"Turning and turning in the widening gyre"—the **repeated present participle** creates ongoing circular motion. The **polysyndeton** ("and turning") emphasizes the repetition.

The **modifier "widening"** (present participle modifying "gyre") creates expansion—the circle grows larger, more unstable.

### Modal Negative
"The falcon cannot hear the falconer"—the **modal "cannot"** expresses impossibility, not prohibition. The syntax makes this about breakdown of communication, relationship, order.

The **semicolon** creates pause while maintaining connection to what follows.

### Paratactic Fragments
"Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold"—two **independent clauses** connected by semicolon. The first ("Things fall apart") is remarkably simple: subject-verb-adverb. This simplicity makes it devastating.

The second clause parallels the first syntactically: subject + modal negative + verb. The **anaphoric "cannot"** links this to previous line.

### Abstract Subject
"the centre"—this **definite article + abstract noun** as subject. What centre? The syntax doesn't specify, making it universal: THE centre (of civilization, of order, of meaning).

### Another Semicolon
Yeats uses **semicolons** rather than periods, creating connected series of catastrophes. The syntax refuses full stops—one disaster flows into the next.

### Passive Construction
"Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world"—the **passive voice** emphasizes the result (anarchy loosed) rather than agent (who loosed it?). The **past participle "loosed"** (archaic for "loosened" or "released") suggests deliberate unleashing.

The **adjective "Mere"** before "anarchy" is ironic—not "mere" (ordinary/insignificant) but MERE (pure, absolute).

The **prepositional phrase "upon the world"** specifies scope—not local but global catastrophe.

### Progressive Syntax
The passage moves from:
1. Present progressive action (turning)
2. Present inability (cannot hear, cannot hold)
3. Present simple disaster (fall apart)
4. Present passive unleashing (is loosed)

This **syntactic progression** through tenses and voices creates gathering catastrophe.

### Line Breaks and Syntax
The **enjambment** between lines creates tension—"widening gyre / The falcon" runs over without pause, but the sentence structure creates units that don't match line breaks, creating formal instability matching thematic chaos.

### Stylistic Effect
Through repeated participles, modal negatives, paratactic catastrophes, and passive apocalypse, Yeats creates syntax of civilizational collapse. The form enacts the content: syntactic structures that parallel each other while describing disintegration, semicolons connecting what's falling apart, passives that hide agency in chaos. This is grammar as historical prophecy—syntax that performs the breakdown it describes while maintaining formal control that suggests apocalypse can be articulated, witnessed, recorded even as it unfolds.
