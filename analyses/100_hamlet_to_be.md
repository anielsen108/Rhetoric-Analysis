## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "to be, or not to be"; "to suffer" vs. "to take arms"
*Effect:* Structures entire soliloquy as choice between opposites.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* "slings and arrows"; "sea of troubles"
*Effect:* Makes suffering into warfare; troubles into ocean.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* "sea of troubles"
*Effect:* Intensifies overwhelming nature of suffering.

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh)
*Definition:* One verb governing different objects.
*Example:* "to suffer / The slings and arrows" then "to take arms against"
*Effect:* Creates grammatical tension between passive suffering and active resistance.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Infinitive Opposition
"To be, or not to be"—**two infinitives** separated by disjunctive conjunction. Syntax reduces existence to binary choice.

### Demonstrative Copula
"that is the question"—**demonstrative pronoun** with copula. Syntax names the antithesis as philosophical problem.

### Indirect Question
"Whether 'tis nobler"—**subordinate interrogative clause** continues question. Syntax embeds moral evaluation in existential choice.

### Infinitive Complements
"to suffer...Or to take"—**two infinitive phrases** as alternatives. Syntax creates parallel structure for opposed actions.

### Prepositional Abstraction
"in the mind"—**prepositional phrase** locates nobility mentally, not physically. Syntax makes this philosophical, internal.

### Mixed Metaphor
"take arms against a sea"—**military metaphor** (arms) meets natural metaphor (sea). Syntax creates impossible action, suggesting futility of resistance.

### Genitive Accumulation
"The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"—**two nouns** in genitive relation to personified fortune. Syntax makes suffering fortune's weaponry.

### Stylistic Effect
Through infinitive opposition, embedded interrogatives, parallel infinitive structures, and mixed metaphors (military vs. oceanic), Shakespeare creates syntax of philosophical paralysis—grammar that performs the inability to choose between being and non-being, suffering and action.
