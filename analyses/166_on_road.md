# Passage 166: "On the Road"

## Author and Source
**Jack Kerouac**, *On the Road* (1957)

## Passage
> The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved"
*Effect:* Creates crescendo of manic energy.

### **Polysyndeton** (pah-lee-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Many conjunctions.
*Example:* "never yawn or say"
*Effect:* Refuses pauses, maintains breathless pace.

### **Simile** (SIM-uh-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* "like fabulous yellow roman candles"; "like spiders"
*Effect:* Creates layered visual metaphors.

### **Epizeuxis** (ep-uh-ZOOK-sis)
*Definition:* Immediate repetition.
*Example:* "burn, burn, burn"
*Effect:* Intensifies through triple repetition.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Restrictive Dative
"The only people for me"—**superlative restriction** with dative. Syntax makes exclusive claim.

### Copulative Series
"are the mad ones"—**copula** with nominal. Syntax defines preferred people.

### Appositive Accumulation
"the ones who are mad to..."—**restrictive relative** beginning definition. Syntax starts building through apposition.

### Anaphoric Infinitives
"mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved"—**three parallel infinitive phrases**. Syntax accelerates through repetition.

### Participial Desire
"desirous of everything"—**participial adjective** with universal object. Syntax shows insatiable appetite.

### Temporal Simultaneity
"at the same time"—**temporal phrase**. Syntax demands impossible all-at-once.

### Negative Relatives
"who never yawn or say a commonplace thing"—**negative relative clause**. Syntax defines through rejection of ordinary.

### Adversative Climax
"but burn, burn, burn"—**coordinating conjunction** with triple verb. Syntax makes burning the opposite of mundane.

### Layered Similes
"like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders"—**two similes**, one inside the other. Syntax creates nested visual comparisons.

### Prepositional Vastness
"across the stars"—**spatial preposition** with cosmic scope. Syntax makes individual burn cosmically visible.

### Stylistic Effect
Through restrictive only-people, anaphoric mad-infinitives, participial desirous-of-everything, simultaneous temporal demand, negative never-commonplace, adversative triple burn, and nested similes of yellow-candles-like-spiders across cosmic stars, Kerouac creates syntax of Beat ecstasy—grammar that refuses pauses or limitations, accumulating energy through repetition and exploding into layered visual metaphors of manic transcendence.
