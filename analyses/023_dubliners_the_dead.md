# Passage 023: Dubliners - "The Dead" Ending

## Author and Source
**James Joyce**, *Dubliners* (1914), "The Dead"

## Passage
> His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Alliteration** (uh-lit-uh-RAY-shun)
*Definition:* Repetition of initial consonant sounds.
*Example:* "soul swooned slowly"; "falling faintly...faintly falling"; "last...living"
*Effect:* Creates hypnotic, dreamlike rhythm; emphasizes key words.

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus)
*Definition:* Reversal of grammatical structures in successive phrases.
*Example:* "falling faintly...faintly falling"
*Effect:* Creates symmetry and sense of eternal repetition; snow falls endlessly.

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison using "like" or "as."
*Example:* "like the descent of their last end"
*Effect:* Transforms snow into metaphor for death and ultimate unity.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition of ideas.
*Example:* "the living and the dead"
*Effect:* Unites opposites; suggests death erases distinctions.

### **Synesthesia** (sin-es-THEE-zhuh)
*Definition:* Mixing of sensory impressions.
*Example:* "heard the snow falling"—visual phenomenon described through auditory verb.
*Effect:* Creates impossible, transcendent perception; suggests altered consciousness.

### **Polyptoton** (pol-ip-TOH-ton)
*Definition:* Repetition of words derived from the same root.
*Example:* "falling...falling"; implicit "dead" (in "The Dead" title) and "dead" (in text)
*Effect:* Creates echo and emphasis through repetition with variation.

### **Amplification** (am-plih-fih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Expanding a simple statement through addition of details.
*Example:* The sentence builds from personal (his soul) to universal (the universe) to metaphysical (living and dead).
*Effect:* Creates expanding vision from individual to cosmic consciousness.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Subject and Verb
"His soul swooned slowly"—the sentence begins with **possessive + subject + verb + adverb**. This is syntactically straightforward but semantically complex.

The **subject "His soul"** (not "he") creates psychological depth—we're not in the realm of physical action but spiritual/emotional experience. The syntax through subject choice elevates the register.

The verb **"swooned"** is archaic, poetic—meaning to faint or enter altered consciousness. The syntax through verb choice creates elevated, literary tone. Modern prose would say "he felt faint" or "he became overwhelmed," but Joyce uses "swooned."

The **alliterative s-sounds** ("soul swooned slowly") create sonic linkage. The syntax becomes almost musical through sound patterning.

The adverb **"slowly"** emphasizes duration and gradualness. The syntax doesn't give us sudden swooning but extended process—consciousness gradually altering.

### Subordinate Temporal Clause
"as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe"—this **subordinate clause** introduced by "as" provides the cause/accompaniment of the swooning. The syntax uses temporal conjunction that can mean "while" (simultaneity) or "because" (causality), allowing both readings.

### Synesthetic Verb
"he heard the snow falling"—the **verb "heard"** with object "snow falling" creates syntactic normalcy for semantic impossibility. Snow falling is typically visual and silent, but the syntax treats it as auditory experience.

This **synesthetic construction** (auditory verb + visual object) is grammatically standard but perceptually impossible, creating what Joyce calls an "epiphany"—a moment of transcendent perception beyond normal sensory bounds.

### Present Participle
"falling"—the **present participle** creates sense of ongoing action. The syntax doesn't use past tense (fell) or perfect (had fallen) but progressive aspect, suggesting continuous, eternal falling.

### Adverb Placement
"falling faintly"—the **adverb "faintly"** modifies "falling." The syntax creates soft, almost imperceptible quality. The f-alliteration (falling/faintly) creates sonic delicacy matching semantic content.

### Spatial Extension
"through the universe"—this **prepositional phrase** expands the spatial scope dramatically. The syntax moves from personal (his soul) to cosmic (universe). This is what Tufte calls **syntactic expansion**—the sentence physically grows to encompass larger and larger scope.

The definite article **"the universe"** (not "a universe") makes this THE universe—all of existence. The syntax makes the claim absolute.

### Chiastic Reversal
"and faintly falling"—this **coordinate phrase** reverses the previous structure:
- First: "falling faintly" (participle + adverb)
- Second: "faintly falling" (adverb + participle)

This **chiasmus** creates symmetry and creates the sense of eternal return, repetition, cyclical motion. The syntax through reversal suggests perpetual falling, snow as eternal condition.

The **coordinating conjunction "and"** links what are essentially the same phrase, but the reversal makes it feel like addition, accumulation, continuation. The syntax creates the sense: it keeps falling and falling.

### Simile Introduction
"like the descent of their last end"—the **simile** introduced by "like" compares the snow's falling to abstract concept. The syntax uses:
- Comparative: "like"
- Object: "the descent" (nominalized verb—falling becomes descent)
- Modification: "of their last end"

This **noun phrase** is dense with meaning compressed through syntax. "The descent of their last end" is a complex genitive construction: the descent that IS their last end, or the descent OF (belonging to) their last end?

### "Their Last End"
The phrase **"their last end"** uses:
- Possessive: "their" (whose? All people? The living and dead?)
- Modifier: "last" (final)
- Noun: "end" (death, termination, purpose/telos)

This **syntactic compression** packs theological language (Last End is Catholic terminology for ultimate purpose/heaven) into three words. The syntax through religious vocabulary creates metaphysical dimension.

### Prepositional Phrase of Location
"upon all the living and the dead"—this **final prepositional phrase** specifies where the snow/descent falls. The syntax creates the climactic revelation:

The preposition **"upon"** (not "on") is formal, elevated, almost Biblical in register.

The object **"all the living and the dead"** uses:
- Quantifier: "all" (universal, without exception)
- Article: "the" (definite—THE living, THE dead—all who exist in those categories)
- Adjectives as nouns: "living" and "dead" (participles/adjectives functioning as substantive nouns)
- Coordination: "and" (linking the two states)

This **syntactic structure** (article + adjective-as-noun) creates abstract, universal categories. The syntax doesn't say "all living people and all dead people" but compresses to "the living and the dead"—making life and death themselves into parallel conditions.

### Antithesis Resolution
The pairing **"the living and the dead"** creates antithesis (ultimate opposition) but the syntax treats them in parallel, equal structures, both receiving the snow equally. This **syntactic parallelism** containing semantic opposition suggests their ultimate unity—the snow/death/final end falls on both equally.

### Sentence Length and Structure
This is a **single sentence** of 32 words, but it feels much longer because of its **syntactic density** and **cosmic scope**. The sentence is:
- Main clause: "His soul swooned slowly"
- Subordinate temporal: "as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe"
- Coordinate addition: "and faintly falling"
- Simile: "like the descent of their last end"
- Prepositional phrase: "upon all the living and the dead"

The **syntactic structure** moves from simple (main clause) through increasingly complex modifying elements, accumulating meaning and expanding scope.

### Progressive Expansion
Notice the **syntactic movement** from small to large:
- His soul (individual, internal)
- he heard (personal perception)
- the snow (particular phenomenon)
- through the universe (cosmic scope)
- their last end (metaphysical/theological)
- all the living and the dead (universal humanity)

The **syntax enacts** an expanding consciousness, moving from individual experience to universal vision.

### Repetition Strategy
The sentence uses **repetition with variation**:
- "falling faintly...faintly falling" (chiasmus)
- "His soul...he" (same referent, varied syntax)
- The concept of falling/descent appears three times in different forms

This **repetitive syntax** creates incantatory, hypnotic effect, appropriate for altered consciousness.

### Alliterative Pattern
The **f-sounds** dominate:
- falling
- faintly
- faintly
- falling

The syntax through phonetic patterning creates soft, susurrant effect—we hear what Gabriel hears, the soft whisper of falling snow.

### Temporal Ambiguity
The **verb tenses** create temporal ambiguity:
- "swooned" (simple past—completed action)
- "heard" (simple past)
- "falling" (present participle—ongoing action)
- "falling" (present participle—ongoing)

The syntax mixes **completed past** (swooned, heard) with **progressive aspect** (falling), creating temporal slippage—is this moment over or ongoing? The syntax suggests Gabriel's swoon continues, the snow falls eternally.

### Absence of Full Stops
Notice the sentence **doesn't pause internally** except for commas. There are no semicolons, dashes, or periods until the end. This **syntactic continuity** mirrors the continuous falling of snow—no breaks, just eternal descent.

### Passive Construction Implied
The snow "falling...upon all the living and the dead" implies they **receive** it passively. The syntax doesn't give them agency—they don't act, they're acted upon. Both living and dead are grammatically equivalent objects of the preposition "upon."

### Religious Syntax
The elevated register—"swooned," "upon," "last end," "the living and the dead"—is **Biblical/liturgical syntax**. Joyce, trained by Jesuits, uses the grammatical structures of religious discourse for his secular epiphany. The syntax performs what critics call Joyce's "priest of eternal imagination" role.

### Stylistic Effect
Through chiasmus, alliteration, progressive expansion, and antithesis resolved in syntax, Joyce creates one of the most famous sentences in English literature. The syntax performs Gabriel's expansion of consciousness from personal grief to universal compassion, from individual to cosmic perspective.

As Tufte emphasizes, this is **syntax as vision**—the grammatical structure doesn't just describe Gabriel's revelation but enacts it. The sentence moves outward syntactically as Gabriel's consciousness moves outward spiritually. The parallelism of "the living and the dead" performs in grammar what the epiphany reveals in theme: death unites all, snow falls on everyone equally, distinctions dissolve in the end.

The chiastic "falling faintly...faintly falling" creates sonic and syntactic beauty that mirrors the beauty Gabriel perceives in this moment of terrible wisdom. This is syntax at its most musical, most spiritual, most achieving of what Pater said: all art aspires to the condition of music. Joyce's syntax here becomes music, becomes prayer, becomes the snow itself—eternal, indifferent, beautiful, falling upon all alike. Form and content achieve transcendent unity.
