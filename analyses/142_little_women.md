## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Tautology** (taw-TAH-luh-jee)
*Definition:* Saying same thing twice.
*Example:* "Christmas won't be Christmas"
*Effect:* Paradoxically suggests holiday loses essence without gifts.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "without any presents" - negative construction.
*Effect:* Emphasizes absence through double negative structure.

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh)
*Definition:* Verb governing different objects.
*Example:* Jo both speaking and "lying on the rug"
*Effect:* Links speech to physical attitude of complaint.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Future Negative Copula
"won't be Christmas"—**future tense with negative contraction**. Syntax predicts loss of essential quality.

### Tautological Subject-Complement
"Christmas...Christmas"—**noun repeated as its own predicate**. Syntax performs philosophical claim about essence.

### Conditional Absence
"without any presents"—**prepositional phrase** of condition. Syntax makes gifts prerequisite for holiday identity.

### Universal Negative
"any presents"—**negative polarity item**. Syntax emphasizes totality of absence.

### Reporting Verb
"grumbled"—**verb of speaking** with negative connotation. Syntax marks tone as complaining.

### Participial Posture
"lying on the rug"—**present participle** showing simultaneous action. Syntax adds physical attitude to speech.

### Direct Speech Opening
Quotation marks open novel. Syntax begins with character voice, not narration.

### Stylistic Effect
Through tautological future negative copula, conditional prepositional absence, negative polarity emphasizing totality, complaining verb, and participial posture, Alcott creates syntax of adolescent discontent—grammar that philosophizes about Christmas's essence while grounding complaint in physical sprawl of youthful protest.
