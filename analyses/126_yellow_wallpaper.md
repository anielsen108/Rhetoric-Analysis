# Passage 126: "The Yellow Wallpaper"

## Author and Source
**Charlotte Perkins Gilman**, "The Yellow Wallpaper" (1892)

## Passage
> It is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure ancestral halls for the summer. A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity—but that would be asking too much of fate!

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to surface.
*Example:* "romantic felicity" in what becomes site of psychological breakdown.
*Effect:* Narrator's optimism masks impending horror.

### **Climax** (KLY-maks)
*Definition:* Building to peak.
*Example:* "mansion...estate...haunted house...romantic felicity"
*Effect:* Ascends through increasingly Gothic descriptions.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "very seldom" understates rarity.
*Effect:* Creates modest, self-effacing tone that hides narrator's intelligence.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Negative Frequency Adverb
"very seldom"—**adverb phrase** emphasizing rarity. Syntax minimizes their good fortune.

### Demonstrative Pronoun
"that mere ordinary people"—**relative clause** defines speaker and husband. Syntax performs false modesty.

### Appositive Accumulation
"A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate"—**two noun phrases in apposition**. Syntax piles up romantic descriptors.

### Conditional Ascent
"I would say a haunted house"—**conditional modal** shows narrator's imagination. Syntax performs escalation to Gothic.

### Adversative Restraint
"but that would be asking too much"—**strong adversative** pulls back. Syntax shows narrator censoring herself.

### Prepositional Abstraction
"of fate"—**genitive of abstract noun**. Syntax attributes outcome to external force, not human agency.

### Exclamatory Restraint
Final exclamation mark shows suppressed enthusiasm. Syntax performs emotional self-censorship.

### Stylistic Effect
Through false modesty, appositive Gothic accumulation, conditional imagination, and adversative self-censorship, Gilman creates syntax of constrained female consciousness—grammar showing narrator's intelligence and imagination being policed by propriety and her husband's authority.
