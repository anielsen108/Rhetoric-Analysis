# Passage 181: "The Poisonwood Bible"

## Author and Source
**Barbara Kingsolver**, *The Poisonwood Bible* (1998)

## Passage
> Imagine a ruin so strange it must never have happened. First, picture the forest. I want you to be its conscience, the eyes in the trees.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Apostrophe** (uh-PAHS-truh-fee)
*Definition:* Direct address to reader.
*Example:* "I want you to be"
*Effect:* Creates intimate, commanding relationship with reader.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Reader as "conscience" and "eyes in the trees"
*Effect:* Makes reader into moral witness embedded in landscape.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Seeming contradiction.
*Example:* Ruin "so strange it must never have happened"
*Effect:* Suggests trauma too extreme to be credible.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Imperative Opening
"Imagine"—**command verb**. Syntax makes reader active participant.

### Indefinite Ruin
"a ruin"—**indefinite article** with abstract noun. Syntax refuses to specify disaster.

### Adverbial Intensity
"so strange"—**degree adverb** with adjective. Syntax emphasizes extremity.

### Modal Negation
"must never have happened"—**epistemic modal** with double negative. Syntax creates paradoxical impossibility.

### Imperative Sequence
"First, picture"—**second command** with ordinal. Syntax structures reader's visualization.

### Definite Forest
"the forest"—**definite article**. Syntax treats setting as known, specific.

### Declarative Want
"I want you to be"—**cognitive verb** with infinitive. Syntax makes narrator's desire explicit.

### Possessive Conscience
"its conscience"—**possessive making reader into moral faculty**. Syntax assigns ethical role.

### Appositive Specification
"the eyes in the trees"—**appositive metaphor** with locative. Syntax adds second metaphor for reader's position.

### Stylistic Effect
Through imperative imagine/picture commands, indefinite ruin with paradoxical must-never-have-happened, declarative I-want-you, possessive its-conscience assignment, and appositive eyes-in-trees metaphor, Kingsolver creates syntax of readerly conscription—grammar that commands audience into specific position as embedded moral witness to impossible catastrophe.
