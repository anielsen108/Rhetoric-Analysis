## Author and Source
**Arundhati Roy**, *The God of Small Things* (1997)

## Passage
> May in Ayemenem is a hot, brooding month. The days are long and humid. The river shrinks and black crows gorge on bright mangoes in still, dustgreen trees. Red bananas ripen. Jackfruits burst.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Month that "broods"; fruits that "burst"
*Effect:* Makes landscape emotionally charged, volatile.

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions.
*Example:* "River shrinks...crows gorge...bananas ripen...jackfruits burst"
*Effect:* Creates staccato rhythm of accumulated observations.

### **Synesthesia** (sin-es-THEE-zhuh)
*Definition:* Mixing sensory modes.
*Example:* "dustgreen" - combining texture and color
*Effect:* Fuses visual and tactile into compound sensation.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Copulative Definition
"May...is a hot, brooding month"—**subject-copula-complement** with two adjectives. Syntax defines through temperature and emotion.

### Locative Specification
"in Ayemenem"—**spatial preposition** with place name. Syntax anchors universal month to specific location.

### Coordinate Adjectives
"hot, brooding"—**two adjectives**, one physical, one emotional. Syntax pairs objective and subjective qualities.

### Copulative Simplicity
"The days are long and humid"—**subject-copula-coordinated adjectives**. Syntax uses basic structure for atmospheric facts.

### Intransitive Shrinking
"The river shrinks"—**definite subject** with intransitive verb. Syntax shows diminishment.

### Coordinate Gorging
"black crows gorge on bright mangoes"—**color-adjective subject** with transitive verb and color-adjective object. Syntax pairs dark/bright contrast.

### Locative Trees
"in still, dustgreen trees"—**prepositional phrase** with neologistic compound adjective. Syntax creates stillness through invented color-texture word.

### Serial Intransitives
"Red bananas ripen. Jackfruits burst."—**two subject-verb sentences**. Syntax uses fragments for staccato effect.

### Color Opening
"Red bananas"—**color adjective**. Syntax makes unexpected color-fruit combination.

### Violent Culmination
"burst"—**explosive verb**. Syntax makes ripening violent.

### Stylistic Effect
Through copulative hot-brooding personification, locative Ayemenem anchoring, intransitive shrinking river, color-contrasted black-crows-on-bright-mangoes, neologistic dustgreen compound, asyndetic fragmentary ripening/bursting, and violent burst culmination, Roy creates syntax of tropical intensity—grammar that accumulates sensory details through simple structures building to explosive climax.
