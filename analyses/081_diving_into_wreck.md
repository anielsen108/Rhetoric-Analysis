## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "and loaded...and checked" repeated.
*Effect:* Creates ritualistic preparation; emphasizes methodical action.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* "book of myths" as guide; "body-armor" as wetsuit.
*Effect:* Transforms diving into mythological quest.

### **Polysyndeton** (pah-lee-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Many conjunctions.
*Example:* "and...and...and" connecting actions.
*Effect:* Slows pace; makes preparation solemn and deliberate.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Participle Opening
"First having read"—**present perfect participle** creates temporal sequence. Syntax marks reading as prerequisite to action.

### Polysyndetic Series
"and loaded...and checked"—**coordinating conjunctions** connect each step. Unlike asyndeton (no conjunctions), polysyndeton slows the rhythm, making each action significant.

### Line Breaks as Syntax
Enjambment after "I put on" creates **syntactic suspense**—we wait for the object. Line break enacts the pause before descent.

### Metaphoric Naming
"body-armor of black rubber"—**genitive metaphor** (armor OF rubber) transforms wetsuit into protective gear for battle. Syntax makes diving dangerous quest.

### Stylistic Effect
Through participle sequence, polysyndetic conjunction, and metaphoric transformation of equipment, Rich creates syntax of ritual preparation—grammar that makes personal journey into mythic dive.
