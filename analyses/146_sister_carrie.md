# Passage 146: "Sister Carrie"

## Author and Source
**Theodore Dreiser**, *Sister Carrie* (1900)

## Passage
> When a girl leaves her home at eighteen, she does one of two things. Either she falls into saving hands and becomes better, or she rapidly assumes the cosmopolitan standard of virtue and becomes worse.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "becomes better, or...becomes worse"
*Effect:* Creates binary moral framework.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "cosmopolitan standard of virtue" for urban immorality.
*Effect:* Ironically uses elevated language for moral decline.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* "saving hands" for protective people/institutions.
*Effect:* Makes rescue seem physical, tangible.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Temporal Subordinate Clause
"When a girl leaves her home at eighteen"—**subordinate clause** with specific age. Syntax establishes universal condition.

### Indefinite Subject
"a girl"—**indefinite article**. Syntax makes observation about type, not individual.

### Numerical Finality
"at eighteen"—**specific age** marking transition. Syntax pinpoints moment of vulnerability.

### Copulative Action
"she does one of two things"—**limited enumeration**. Syntax reduces possibilities to binary.

### Disjunctive Structure
"Either...or"—**correlative conjunctions**. Syntax forces exclusive choice.

### Passive Reception
"falls into saving hands"—**intransitive verb** with prepositional destination. Syntax makes salvation something she falls into, not chooses.

### Adverbial Speed
"rapidly assumes"—**manner adverb** with active verb. Syntax shows quick corruption.

### Ironic Phrase
"cosmopolitan standard of virtue"—**elevated diction** for degradation. Syntax performs euphemistic evasion.

### Parallel Copulative Outcomes
"becomes better...becomes worse"—**two parallel copulative constructions**. Syntax creates symmetrical moral opposites.

### Stylistic Effect
Through temporal-conditional universalizing, indefinite typical subject, binary enumeration, disjunctive either/or, passive falling into rescue versus rapid assumption of ironic "cosmopolitan virtue," and parallel copulative moral outcomes, Dreiser creates syntax of naturalist determinism—grammar that reduces female agency to binary fate determined by circumstance.
