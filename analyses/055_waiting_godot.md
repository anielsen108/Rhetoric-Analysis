# Passage 055: "Let's go." / "We can't." (*Waiting for Godot*)

**Samuel Beckett** · *En attendant Godot* / *Waiting for Godot* · 1953 | Act I opening exchange

**Occasion/Pressure:** Establish the play’s absurd stasis in five lines—desire, prohibition, explanation.
**Persona/Stance:** Dialogue between Estragon and Vladimir; minimalist, ritualistic.
**Thesis of Effect:** Alternating imperatives, negatives, and interrogatives compress the existential dilemma: perpetual urge to depart thwarted by self-imposed waiting.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Stichomythia** (stik-oh-MITH-ee-uh)
**Evidence:** One-line exchanges.
**Effect:** Rapid rhythm mirrors futility loop.

### **Antithesis**
**Evidence:** "Let's go" vs. "We can't."
**Effect:** Action and prohibition collide.

### **Ellipsis**
**Evidence:** "Why not?" omits subject/verb.
**Effect:** Speech stripped to bare bone; urgency without ornament.

### **Minimalism**
**Evidence:** Monosyllabic "Ah!"
**Effect:** Entire emotional response reduced to single exhalation.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Imperative/Modal pairing**
**Evidence:** L1 imperative, L2 modal negative.
**Effect:** Structure embodies desire thwarted.

### **Question/Answer pattern**
**Evidence:** L3 & L4.
**Effect:** Creates logical surface over absurd content.

### **Progressive Aspect**
**Evidence:** "We're waiting."
**Effect:** Continuous action with no completion; stasis in grammar.

### **Exclamatory Fragment**
**Evidence:** "Ah!"
**Effect:** Recognition without articulation; meaning collapsed into sound.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Clause Economy**
**Signals:** Each line minimal words yet complete speech act.
**Effect:** Forces audience to confront emptiness directly.

### **Present Progressive Trap**
**Signals:** "are waiting."
**Effect:** Time suspended; characters stuck in ongoing present.

### **Turn-taking symmetry**
**Signals:** Alternating speakers.
**Effect:** Ritualized banter; syntax itself repeats like waiting cycle.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Plosive "Let's" / "We" create bounce; "Ah" sighs out.

**Cadence:** 2 words → 2 → 2 → 4 → 1. Expansion then collapse.

**Music:** Beats like drum hits; last "Ah" acts as cymbal fade.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence types:** Imperative, declarative negative, interrogative, declarative progressive, interjection.

**Modification:** None—no adjectives, adverbs; pure verbs/pronouns.

**Information flow:** Proposal → refusal → inquiry → rationale → resigned acknowledgment.

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** Already minimal.
- **Dilated:** *"Let us depart." / "We are unable." / "For what reason?" etc.—sounds stiff, loses absurd charm.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deixis:** Present-tense pronouns "we"; no external references.

**Aspect:** Progressive "are waiting" keeps them trapped.

**Modality:** "can't" expresses inability, not prohibition from outside authority.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor family:** Waiting as life; absence of Godot as absence of meaning.

**Lexical field:** Movement verbs (go, waiting) ironically produce stillness.

**Image logic:** Action words describe inaction; language undermines itself.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Dialogue—no narrator; audience observes ritual.

**Time:** Immediate present; no backstory yet.

**Beat structure:** Suggest departure, deny, question, justify, resign.

**Subtext:** Human condition defined by self-imposed obligations to unseen authority.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Characters acknowledge predicament candidly; trust established.

**Pathos:** Audience feels futility; "Ah!" captures despair/recognition.

**Logos:** Logic present but circular—premise (waiting) prevents solution (leaving).

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Classical stichomythia:** Echoes Greek tragedy but empties content.

**Absurdist theatre:** Foreshadows Pinter’s pauses, Albee’s loops.

**Philosophical existentialism:** Camus/Sartre’s absurd reasoning dramatized.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"Let's go."** — eternal desire.
2. **"We can't."** — self-imposed cage.
3. **"We're waiting for Godot."** — central mystery.

### Faultlines
1. **Godot undefined**—audience left in ignorance intentionally.
2. **Language minimalism** may frustrate; that’s the point.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove "Ah!"—exchange loses emotional release.

**Amplification test:** Add explanation of Godot—destroys mystery.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"Let us depart." / "We cannot."* — comedic stiffness.
- **Colloquial:** *"Let's split." / "We can't."* — modern slang shifts tone.

**Punctuation swap:** Replace dash with period? None present; punctuation already minimal.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *A: "Let's start." B: "We shouldn't." A: "Why not?" B: "We're waiting for the signal." A: "Oh."*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *"Let's go." / "No."* — loses logic loop.

**Compression (≤25 words):** Already ≤25 words total.

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Alternate imperative and negation to dramatize stalemate.
2. Use progressive aspect to portray endless waiting.
3. Strip syntax to bare essentials to foreground existential void.
4. Finish exchange with interjection to imply unspeakable realization.
5. Keep line lengths short to create musical pattern.
6. Let absence of detail generate audience curiosity.
7. Employ dialogue alone to sketch world rules.
