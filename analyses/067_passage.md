## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Night as adversity; pit as despair; soul as fortress.
*Effect:* Makes abstract suffering concrete and spatial.

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* "Black as the pit from pole to pole"
*Effect:* Emphasizes totality of darkness through geographic scope.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nif-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Attribution of human qualities.
*Example:* Night "covers" (protective/smothering action).
*Effect:* Makes circumstances seem active, intentional.

### **Litotes** (LIE-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "unconquerable" (cannot be conquered—double negative becomes emphatic positive).
*Effect:* Emphasizes invincibility through negative construction.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Prepositional Opening
"Out of the night that covers me"—begins with **prepositional phrase of origin/source**. The syntax positions speaker as emerging FROM darkness, not merely IN it.

The **relative clause "that covers me"** specifies which night—the one that covers (oppresses, surrounds) him.

### Comparative Clause
"Black as the pit from pole to pole"—**comparative structure** using "as...as" creates simile. The **prepositional phrase "from pole to pole"** (North to South pole) creates global scope.

The syntax through geographic reference makes personal darkness universal, cosmic.

### First Person Declaration
"I thank whatever gods may be"—**subject-verb-object**. The **first person "I"** asserts agency despite circumstances.

The **compound relative pronoun "whatever gods"** + **modal "may be"** creates agnosticism—he doesn't know if gods exist, but thanks them anyway. The syntax through modal uncertainty makes this philosophical, not religious.

### Prepositional Phrase of Reason
"For my unconquerable soul"—the **preposition "For"** introduces reason for thanksgiving. The syntax culminates in the key assertion.

The **possessive "my"** + **adjective "unconquerable"** + **noun "soul"** creates the poem's central claim. The **morphology** of "unconquerable" (un- + conquer + -able) creates triple assertion: not + able to + conquer = absolutely cannot be conquered.

### Stylistic Effect
Through metaphoric geography, agnostic thanksgiving, and multiply-negated assertion of invincibility, Henley creates Victorian stoicism. The syntax performs defiance—emerging OUT OF darkness, thanking uncertain gods FOR unconquerable self. Form IS the unconquerable spirit—grammar that asserts self despite all opposition.
