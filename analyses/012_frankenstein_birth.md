## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Pathetic Fallacy** (puh-THET-ik FAL-uh-see)
*Definition:* Attribution of human emotions to nature.
*Example:* "dreary night"—the night reflects the emotional tone of events.
*Effect:* Establishes ominous atmosphere; suggests nature's disapproval or foreboding.

### **Circumlocution** (sir-kum-loh-KYOO-shun)
*Definition:* Use of many words where fewer would do.
*Example:* "accomplishment of my toils" instead of "finished my work"; "infuse a spark of being" instead of "animate."
*Effect:* Creates formal, elevated tone; suggests speaker's discomfort with direct statement of terrible actions.

### **Litotes** (LIE-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement using negative construction.
*Example:* "anxiety that almost amounted to agony"
*Effect:* The hedging "almost" understates what must be complete agony, suggesting narrator's resistance to fully admitting his emotional state.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-feh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression substituted for one considered harsh or blunt.
*Example:* "lifeless thing" instead of "corpse" or "body"
*Effect:* Victor distances himself from the horror of what he's done; avoids confronting the reality.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* "spark of being" for life/animation
*Effect:* Makes the scientific process seem almost mystical; suggests Promethean theft of divine fire.

### **Periphrasis** (puh-RIF-ruh-sis)
*Definition:* Roundabout way of speaking.
*Example:* "instruments of life" instead of naming specific tools
*Effect:* Maintains vagueness about the actual process; creates distance from the gruesome reality.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Temporal Frame
"It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld"—this is a **cleft sentence** (using "It was...that" construction) that emphasizes the temporal setting. Normal word order would be "I beheld the accomplishment of my toils on a dreary night of November," but the syntax places the time first, giving it unusual emphasis.

The **expletive construction "It was"** (also called existential "it") delays the subject ("I") and main verb ("beheld"), creating suspense and formality. This is characteristic of Gothic prose—the syntax enacts delay and atmosphere before reaching action.

### Embedded Modification
"on a dreary night of November"—the **temporal prepositional phrase** contains nested modification:
- "on a night" (temporal location)
- "dreary night" (atmospheric adjective)
- "of November" (further temporal specification)

The syntax builds from general (night) to specific (November), but the key modifier is "dreary," which isn't temporal but emotional. The syntax embeds subjective judgment in objective temporal framing.

### Elevated Verb Choice
"beheld"—this **archaic verb** instead of "saw" or "witnessed" elevates the register. It's Biblical/poetic diction, suggesting Victor sees himself as participating in something momentous, even sacred. The syntactic formality distances him from the horror of what he's done.

### Nominalization
"the accomplishment of my toils"—this **noun phrase** transforms verbs (accomplish, toil) into nouns. The syntax buries the action in abstraction. Victor doesn't say "I finished making the creature" but uses this indirect, nominalized construction.

This is what linguists call **grammatical metaphor**—using nouns for processes. It's characteristic of formal, scientific discourse and also serves to distance the speaker from agency and action.

### Adverbial Modification with Qualification
"With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony"—this **prepositional phrase** modifies the main action ("I collected"). The syntax is complex:
- "With an anxiety" (instrumental prepositional phrase)
- "that almost amounted to" (relative clause with qualification)
- "agony" (the nearly-but-not-quite-admitted extreme)

The **relative clause "that almost amounted to agony"** could be omitted (just "With an anxiety" would suffice), but the syntax insists on qualification. The modal adverb "almost" is crucial—Victor can't quite admit to "agony," only something that "almost amounted to" it.

This **syntactic hedging** characterizes Victor throughout: he approaches but can't quite reach direct statement of his feelings or actions.

### Action Verb Delayed
"I collected the instruments of life around me"—finally, after much preamble, we get a concrete action: "I collected." The syntax has delayed this through the cleft construction and the elaborate adverbial phrase. When the action finally comes, it's somewhat anticlimactic—"collected" seems too mild for the momentousness being claimed.

The **phrasal verb "collected...around me"** suggests gathering things in a circle, perhaps ritualistically. The spatial positioning "around me" makes Victor the center, emphasizing his agency and isolation.

### Vague Object
"the instruments of life"—this **noun phrase** is deliberately vague. What instruments? The plural suggests multiple tools, but the syntax refuses to specify. The modifier "of life" is ambiguous: instruments that create life, or instruments that belong to life?

This **periphrastic construction** (using many words to avoid direct statement) maintains Gothic vagueness. The syntax obscures rather than clarifies.

### Purpose Clause
"that I might infuse a spark of being"—this **subordinate purpose clause** (introduced by "that") uses the **modal auxiliary "might"** with subjunctive sense. The syntax expresses purpose/intention: why did he collect the instruments? To animate the creature.

The choice of "might" (rather than "could" or "would") suggests both permission and possibility—the subjunctive mood appropriate for contemplated action.

### Metaphorical Verb Phrase
"infuse a spark of being"—the syntax uses sophisticated metaphor embedded in verb phrase structure:
- "infuse" (verb: to pour in, instill)
- "a spark" (object: metaphor for life)
- "of being" (prepositional phrase modifying "spark")

This is elevated, almost poetic syntax for what's actually a horrifying act of reanimation. The metaphor of "spark" (fire/electricity/divine inspiration) through the verb "infuse" (liquid action) creates mixed vehicular metaphors that maintain ambiguity about what actually happens.

### Prepositional Phrase: Location and State
"into the lifeless thing that lay before me"—the **prepositional phrase of direction** ("into") specifies where the spark goes. The object of the preposition is heavily modified:
- "the lifeless thing" (noun phrase with evaluative adjective)
- "that lay before me" (relative clause of position)

The word "thing" is striking—not "body," not "creature," not "being," but the dehumanizing "thing." The syntax enacts Victor's psychological distancing from his creation.

The verb "lay" is intransitive and passive—the creature/thing does nothing; it is acted upon. The prepositional phrase "before me" creates spatial relationship: Victor above/active, creature below/passive.

### Sentence Length and Complexity
The passage consists of two sentences, the second much longer and more complex than the first. This **syntactic expansion** mirrors the movement from setting to action. The cumulative complexity of the second sentence, with its nested clauses and qualifications, enacts Victor's complicated mental state—unable to state things simply or directly.

### Passive and Agentless Constructions
Note how the syntax often obscures agency:
- "It was on a dreary night" (expletive construction)
- "the accomplishment of my toils" (nominalization)
- "lifeless thing that lay" (intransitive verb)

Even when Victor uses first person ("I beheld," "I collected"), the syntax surrounds his actions with abstractions and qualifications that diffuse responsibility.

### Stylistic Effect
Through cleft sentences, nominalizations, euphemisms, and elaborate modifications, Shelley creates syntax that **performs psychological distancing**. Victor cannot speak directly about what he's doing because to do so would be to confront its horror fully. The syntax is educated, formal, even elevated—maintaining the language of science and philosophy while describing what is essentially desecration and presumption. The elaborate structures keep reality at bay.

As Tufte would note, this is syntax as character psychology: the circumlocutions and qualifications aren't ornament but revelation. A man who could say simply "On November night I finished my creature and prepared to animate the corpse before me" would be a different character. Victor's syntax IS his character—educated, sophisticated, unable to face directly what he has done, hiding behind abstraction and metaphor. The form is the meaning.
