# Passage 116: "The Sea's Voice"

## Author and Source
**Kate Chopin**, *The Awakening* (1899)

## Passage
> The voice of the sea is seductive; never ceasing, whispering, clamoring, murmuring, inviting the soul to wander for a spell in abysses of solitude; to lose itself in mazes of inward contemplation.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to non-human.
*Example:* Sea has "voice" that "whispers," "clamors," "murmurs," "invites"
*Effect:* Makes nature an active seducer.

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions.
*Example:* "whispering, clamoring, murmuring"
*Effect:* Accelerates accumulation of sea's varied speech.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Inward contemplation as "mazes"; solitude as "abysses"
*Effect:* Makes psychological states into dangerous spaces.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Copulative Declaration
"The voice...is seductive"—**definite article-subject-copula-adjective**. Syntax asserts sea's dangerous appeal.

### Participial Accumulation
"never ceasing, whispering, clamoring, murmuring"—**series of present participles**. Syntax enacts endless variety of sea's speech.

### Participial Purpose
"inviting the soul"—**present participle** with object. Syntax shows sea as active agent of invitation.

### Infinitive Purpose Series
"to wander...to lose itself"—**two infinitive phrases** express purpose. Syntax shows goal of seduction.

### Prepositional Depth
"in abysses of solitude"—**prepositional phrase** with genitive. Syntax makes solitude spatial, dangerous.

### Reflexive Loss
"to lose itself"—**reflexive infinitive**. Syntax performs the dissolution of self the passage describes.

### Second Prepositional Maze
"in mazes of inward contemplation"—**parallel prepositional phrase**. Syntax creates second trap through introspection.

### Stylistic Effect
Through copulative assertion of seduction, asyndetic participial accumulation, purposive infinitives of wandering and loss, and spatial metaphors of abysses and mazes, Chopin creates syntax of dangerous interiority—grammar that makes contemplation and solitude as threatening as they are alluring.
