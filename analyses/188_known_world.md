# Passage 188: "The Known World"

## Author and Source
**Edward P. Jones**, *The Known World* (2003)

## Passage
> Manchester County, Virginia, was the first to impose an eight o'clock curfew for black people. Negroes—slave and free—could not be on county roads and paths after eight.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to surface.
*Example:* Free black people subject to same curfew as enslaved.
*Effect:* Exposes how "freedom" meant little under white supremacy.

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions.
*Example:* "slave and free" without elaboration.
*Effect:* Makes collapsed distinction matter-of-fact.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement.
*Example:* "could not be" for violent enforcement.
*Effect:* Uses neutral modal for brutal reality.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Geographical Subject
"Manchester County, Virginia"—**proper name** with appositive state. Syntax makes location the actor.

### Copulative First
"was the first"—**copula** with superlative. Syntax emphasizes pioneering racism.

### Infinitive Purpose
"to impose"—**purpose infinitive** with transitive verb. Syntax shows deliberate action.

### Temporal Specification
"an eight o'clock curfew"—**indefinite article** with specific time. Syntax makes hour precise.

### Prepositional Target
"for black people"—**benefactive preposition** ironically used. Syntax shows who is targeted.

### Appositive Dash
"Negroes—slave and free—"—**appositive between em-dashes**. Syntax specifies racial category.

### Coordinate Status
"slave and free"—**two nouns coordinated**. Syntax collapses legal distinction.

### Modal Prohibition
"could not be"—**negative modal**. Syntax shows absolute restriction.

### Prepositional Location
"on county roads and paths"—**spatial preposition** with coordinated objects. Syntax specifies banned spaces.

### Temporal After
"after eight"—**temporal preposition** with elliptical hour. Syntax makes nighttime criminal.

### Stylistic Effect
Through geographical Manchester-County subject, copulative was-the-first pioneering, infinitive to-impose deliberation, specific eight-o'clock timing, appositive dash Negroes-slave-and-free collapse, modal could-not prohibition, and prepositional on-roads-and-paths/after-eight spatial-temporal restriction, Jones creates syntax of bureaucratic violence—grammar that presents racist curfew with administrative neutrality, making white supremacist control of black movement seem like mere policy detail.
