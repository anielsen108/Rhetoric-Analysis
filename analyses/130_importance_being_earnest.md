# Passage 130: "The Importance of Being Earnest"

## Author and Source
**Oscar Wilde**, *The Importance of Being Earnest* (1895)

## Passage
> The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "rarely pure and never simple"
*Effect:* Creates philosophical paradox about truth.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* "complete impossibility"
*Effect:* Amplifies consequence of simplicity to absurdity.

### **Parallelism** (pair-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structures.
*Example:* "Modern life would be...and modern literature [would be]"
*Effect:* Links life and literature as equally dependent on complexity.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Seeming contradiction.
*Example:* Truth being impure and complex.
*Effect:* Inverts conventional morality about truth.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Copulative Declaration
"The truth is"—**definite article with copula**. Syntax makes universal claim about truth's nature.

### Adverbial Negation
"rarely pure and never simple"—**two adverbs** modifying adjectives, one negative, one absolute. Syntax creates hierarchy of impossibility.

### Conditional Subjunctive
"would be very tedious if it were either"—**conditional mood** with subjunctive "were." Syntax creates hypothetical contrary to fact.

### Demonstrative Pronoun
"either"—**pronoun** referring back to pure/simple. Syntax economically combines two qualities.

### Elliptical Parallel
"and modern literature a complete impossibility"—**elliptical construction** omitting "would be." Syntax creates epigrammatic compression.

### Adjectival Intensification
"complete impossibility"—**adjective intensifying absolute noun**. Syntax performs rhetorical excess.

### Exclamatory Conclusion
Final exclamation mark. Syntax performs theatrical delivery of epigram.

### Stylistic Effect
Through copulative universal claim, adverbial negation hierarchy, conditional hypothetical, elliptical parallel, and exclamatory conclusion, Wilde creates syntax of paradoxical wit—grammar that inverts conventional morality through epigrammatic compression and theatrical flourish.
