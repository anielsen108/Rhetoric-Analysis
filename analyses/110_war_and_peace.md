# Passage 110: "History and Free Will"

## Author and Source
**Leo Tolstoy**, *War and Peace* (1869, translated from Russian)

## Passage
> The more we try to explain such events in history reasonably, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to us.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "reasonably" opposed to "unreasonable and incomprehensible"
*Effect:* Shows paradox of historical explanation.

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus)
*Definition:* Inverted parallel structure.
*Example:* "try to explain...become" (effort/result inversion)
*Effect:* Shows counterproductive nature of rational analysis.

### **Polysyndeton** (pah-lee-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Multiple conjunctions.
*Example:* "unreasonable and incomprehensible"
*Effect:* Accumulates failure of understanding.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Comparative Structure
"The more we try...the more...do they become"—**correlative comparative** construction. Syntax creates inverse proportion.

### Infinitive Purpose
"to explain"—**infinitive of purpose**. Syntax identifies aim of effort.

### Adverbial Manner
"reasonably"—**manner adverb** modifying attempt. Syntax specifies method that fails.

### Emphatic Inversion
"the more unreasonable...do they become"—**inverted auxiliary**. Syntax creates emphasis through formal word order.

### Compound Predicate Adjective
"unreasonable and incomprehensible"—**two parallel adjectives**. Syntax doubles the failure of understanding.

### First Person Plural
"we try"—**inclusive plural**. Syntax implicates all humans in this epistemological failure.

### Deictic Pronoun
"they"—**pronoun referring to events**. Syntax makes historical events into agents resisting explanation.

### Stylistic Effect
Through correlative comparative, paradoxical inversion (rational effort produces irrational result), and emphatic syntax, Tolstoy creates grammar of historiographic humility—syntax that performs the defeat of rational explanation by historical complexity.
