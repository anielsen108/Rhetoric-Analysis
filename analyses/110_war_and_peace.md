# Passage 110: History versus Reason (*War and Peace*)

**Leo Tolstoy** · *War and Peace* · 1869 | Epilogue, Part 2 (translation: Richard Pevear & Larissa Volokhonsky)

**Occasion/Pressure:** Tolstoy pivots from narrative to philosophy, arguing that attempts to rationalize history fail; sentence must deliver paradox succinctly.
**Persona/Stance:** Philosophical narrator—sober, collective "we" voice diagnosing human cognition.
**Thesis of Effect:** Correlative comparatives and inversion make the sentence enact the futility of rational explanation: the more logic we apply, the more mystery the syntax reveals.

---

## PASSAGE

[L1] The more we try to explain such events in history reasonably, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to us.

---

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks / ˈpærədɒks)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Apparent contradiction that reveals deeper truth.
**Evidence:** Rational explanation produces irrational result.
**Effect:** Encapsulates Tolstoy's philosophy that intellect alone cannot grasp historical causation.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis / ænˈtɪθəsɪs)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Juxtaposition of opposing ideas in balanced structure.
**Evidence:** "reasonably" vs. "unreasonable and incomprehensible."
**Effect:** Highlights gulf between expectation and outcome.

### **Pleonasm** (PLEE-uh-naz-um / ˈpliːənæzəm)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Deliberate redundancy for emphasis.
**Evidence:** Pairing "unreasonable" with "incomprehensible"—similar semantic fields.
**Effect:** Overabundance of negation underscores overwhelming confusion.

### **Inclusive Ethos**
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Using shared pronouns to create communal stance.
**Evidence:** "we" implicates narrator and reader equally.
**Effect:** Argument becomes collective confession, not lecture.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Correlative Construction**
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Paired comparative clauses beginning with "the more."
**Evidence:** "The more we try… the more…"
**Effect:** Sets up logical formula that ironically disproves itself.

### **Inversion (Subject–Auxiliary inversion)**
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Auxiliary precedes subject for emphasis.
**Evidence:** "do they become" rather than "they become."
**Effect:** Formal word order intensifies conclusion, echoing scientific emphasis.

### **Polysyndetic Pairing**
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Multiple conjunctions linking adjectives.
**Evidence:** "unreasonable and incomprehensible."
**Effect:** Adds weight to descriptors, piling confusion.

### **Anaphoric Determiner**
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Repetition of article/pronoun to maintain cohesion.
**Evidence:** "The more" repeated twice frames the clause pair.
**Effect:** Creates chant-like rhythm, reinforcing logical scaffolding even as meaning dissolves.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Iterative Logic Pattern**
**Signals:** Comparative correlatives referencing repeated attempts.
**Effect on stance:** Suggests repeated experiments yield same paradoxical result.
**Classical kin:** Scholastic syllogism structures; Tolstoy turns them inside out.

### **Nominal Precision with Abstract Nouns**
**Signals:** "events," "history," "reasonably."
**Effect:** Academic diction evokes scientific discourse, lending gravity before undercutting it.
**Classical kin:** Enlightenment treatises; Tolstoy subverts their confidence.

### **Pronoun Inclusivity**
**Signals:** "we" as subject.
**Effect:** Removes authorial superiority; all humans share limitation.
**Classical kin:** Augustine's confessional "we" acknowledging weakness.

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Liquid consonants (l, r) in "more," "reasonably" create smoothness, while plosive "k" in "incomprehensible" slams conclusion.

**Cadence seams:** Comma divides twin halves symmetrically; inversion "do they become" produces small drumbeat before final clause.

**Alliteration:** Soft "m" repetition (more, more) mimics mantra, reflecting repeated intellectual attempts.

**Music argues:** Gentle rise of first half promises order; clanging polysyllabic ending enacts collapse into confusion.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Balanced correlative sentence with main clause repeated; second half inverted for emphasis.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** Adverbial "The more…" front-loads condition.
- **Mid:** Infinitive phrase "to explain" and adverb "reasonably" specify method.
- **Postposed:** Predicate adjectives "unreasonable and incomprehensible" plus indirect object "to us" deliver verdict.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Strict symmetry—two comparative clauses tethered by comma; no subordination beyond infinitive complement.

**Information flow:** Effort (try to explain) → method (reasonably) → result (become unreasonable) → experiencer (us).

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"The more rationally we explain history, the less sense it makes."* — Punchy but loses dignified inversion and dual adjectives.
- **Dilated:** *"Every additional effort we expend attempting to rationalize historical events renders those very events ever more refractory to reason, ever more inaccessible to our understanding."* — Expands analysis but sacrifices aphoristic elegance.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Abstract; "we" denotes humanity in general, not specific time/place.

**Aspect:** Simple present indicates timeless truth about human cognition.

**Modality:** Absence of modals gives statement authority; no "might" softens conclusion.

**Temporal logic:** Comparative structure implies iteration over time; each effort intensifies failure.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:** Intellectual (explain, reasonable) vs. irrational (unreasonable, incomprehensible).

**Lexical fields:** Academic reasoning vocabulary merges with emotive confusion lexicon.

**Image logic:** Attempt to impose linear logic on history yields exponential chaos—a conceptual negative feedback loop.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Essayistic narrator outside story world; voice belongs to Tolstoy's philosophical persona.

**Time:** Statement functions as gnomic truth; not bound to narrative chronology.

**Beat structure:** Condition → paradoxical consequence. Minimal but potent.

**Subtext:** Undermines "great man" theory—history resists tidy explanation, preparing for Tolstoy's critique of free will narratives.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Author presents himself as fellow seeker who has discovered universal limitation; no condescension.

**Pathos:** Reader feels shared frustration; adjectives "unreasonable," "incomprehensible" evoke existential humility.

**Logos:** Formal logical structure ironically demonstrates its own failure; argument proves point via lived experience of reading it.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Schopenhauerian skepticism:** Echoes philosophical contemporaries skeptical of rational causation.

**Biblical cadence:** Double "the more" recalls Proverbs' parallelism.

**Modern historiography:** Anticipates 20th-century chaos theory and systems thinking.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"The more we try"** — invites reader into experiment.
2. **"reasonably" vs. "unreasonable"** — pivot from optimism to failure.
3. **"to us"** — final admission of human limits.

### Faultlines
1. **Translation register:** "unreasonable" may feel mild in English. **Fix:** substitute "irrational" for sharper contrast.
2. **Ambiguity of "such events":** Without antecedent, relies on previous context. **Revision test:** add "as the French invasion" for clarity; but loses generality.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove "to us." Result: sentence becomes abstract law without human humility; keeps academic tone but loses confessional resonance.

**Amplification test:** Append "and the more futile our moral judgments seem." Would link to ethics but risk redundancy.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"In proportion as we endeavor to elucidate historical phenomena with rational method, so proportionally do they elude us as irrational and opaque."*
- **Colloquial:** *"The harder we try to make sense of history, the crazier and more confusing it gets for us."*

**Punctuation swap:** Replace comma with semicolon; heightens division but disturbs paired rhythm.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *The more we chart the currents of revolution with tidy diagrams, the more turbulent and unreadable they appear to us.*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *When we study history, it gets hard.* — Loses nuance and logical choreography.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *The more reasonably we try to explain historical events, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible they grow to us.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Use correlative comparatives to dramatize self-defeating effort.
2. Invert auxiliary + subject for emphatic, old-world authority.
3. Pair near-synonymous negatives to thicken sense of bewilderment.
4. Deploy inclusive "we" when critiquing collective intellectual habits.
5. Let syntax embody argument (effort mirrored by consequence).
6. Balance academic diction with emotional adjectives to humanize philosophy.
7. End with "to us" or similar to ground abstract claims in lived experience.
