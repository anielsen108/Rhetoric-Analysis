## Author and Source
**Henry James**, *Daisy Miller* (1878)

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to surface.
*Example:* "grateful for having found the formula"
*Effect:* Exposes Winterbourne's need to categorize rather than understand.

### **Apposition** (ap-uh-ZIH-shun)
*Definition:* Noun phrase restating another.
*Example:* "a flirt—a pretty American flirt"
*Effect:* Refines categorization with qualification.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for blunt reality.
*Example:* "relations with young ladies" for social contact.
*Effect:* Shows Winterbourne's prissy formality.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Past Progressive with Adverb
"Winterbourne was almost grateful"—**past progressive** with hedging adverb. Syntax shows incomplete, qualified emotion.

### Gerund Object
"for having found the formula"—**perfect gerund** as prepositional object. Syntax makes discovery an achievement.

### Relative Clause Application
"that applied to Miss Daisy Miller"—**relative clause** showing formula's function. Syntax treats person as case study.

### Copulative Classification
"She was a flirt"—**simple copula** assigns category. Syntax reduces person to type.

### Em-Dash Refinement
"a flirt—a pretty American flirt"—**em-dash** introduces specification. Syntax performs act of categorizing.

### Triple Adjectival Modification
"pretty American flirt"—**three modifiers** (one noun as adjective). Syntax accumulates defining characteristics.

### Negative Perfect
"He had never, as yet, had"—**negative past perfect** with qualifier. Syntax emphasizes inexperience.

### Euphemistic Object
"any relations with young ladies"—**vague abstract noun** with genteel phrase. Syntax shows Winterbourne's prudishness.

### Genitive Category
"of this category"—**prepositional phrase** classifying people. Syntax treats humans as specimens.

### Stylistic Effect
Through hedged gratitude, gerund of formulaic discovery, copulative reduction of person to type, em-dash refinement, and euphemistic abstraction, James creates syntax of categorizing consciousness—grammar showing how Winterbourne's need to classify prevents genuine human connection.
