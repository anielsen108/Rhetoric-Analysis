## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "I've known rivers" repeated.
*Effect:* Creates incantatory rhythm; emphasizes deep knowledge.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* Rivers "older than...flow of human blood"
*Effect:* Makes rivers primordial, connecting speaker to ancient origins.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Present Perfect Tense
"I've known"—**present perfect** connects past experience to present identity. Syntax makes knowing ongoing, not completed.

### Colon Introduction
Colon after first line creates **syntactic suspense**—we wait to learn what follows the declaration.

### Comparative Structure
"ancient as the world and older than the flow"—**two comparative structures** (as...as and older than) stack to create immense temporal depth.

### Stylistic Effect
Through present perfect, anaphoric repetition, and accumulating comparatives, Hughes creates syntax of ancestral connection—grammar linking personal identity to geological time.
