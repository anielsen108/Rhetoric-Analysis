## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "the end...the darkness...the fall"
*Effect:* Accumulates causes of grief.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* "darkness of man's heart" for human evil.
*Effect:* Makes moral corruption into spatial/visual absence.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "fall through the air" for murder.
*Effect:* Makes killing almost poetic, distanced.

### **Climax** (KLY-maks)
*Definition:* Ascending order of importance.
*Example:* Abstract loss to philosophical to personal death.
*Effect:* Moves from general to specific tragedy.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Simple Past Grief
"Ralph wept"—**subject-intransitive verb**. Syntax makes weeping the complete action.

### Prepositional Causes
"for the end...the darkness...the fall"—**three parallel prepositional phrases**. Syntax lists reasons for tears.

### Genitive Abstraction
"the end of innocence"—**definite article** with abstract genitive. Syntax makes loss definite, irreversible.

### Metaphorical Genitive
"the darkness of man's heart"—**possessive with metaphor**. Syntax locates evil in human core.

### Complex Nominal
"the fall through the air"—**nominal with prepositional modifier**. Syntax euphemizes death as movement.

### Appositive Specification
"of the true, wise friend"—**genitive with adjectives**. Syntax adds qualities to victim.

### Participial Name
"called Piggy"—**past participle**. Syntax reduces character to nickname even in death.

### Asyndetic Series
Final item connected with "and" after commas. Syntax makes personal loss climactic.

### Stylistic Effect
Through simple weeping, three parallel prepositional causes, genitive innocence-end, metaphorical heart-darkness, euphemistic fall-through-air, appositive true-wise-friend, and participial called-Piggy, Golding creates syntax of elegiac comprehension—grammar that accumulates philosophical and personal losses, moving from abstract civilization to individual death, ending with devastating casual nickname that acknowledges how victim was diminished even by protector.
