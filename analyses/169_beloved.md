## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* House number "was spiteful"
*Effect:* Makes address into malevolent entity.

### **Oxymoron** (ahk-see-MOR-ahn)
*Definition:* Contradictory terms.
*Example:* "baby's venom"
*Effect:* Combines innocence with poison.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Associated term for thing.
*Example:* "124" for house
*Effect:* Reduces haunted house to street number.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Numerical Subject
"124"—**house number** as grammatical subject. Syntax makes address into character.

### Copulative Character
"was spiteful"—**subject-copula-adjective**. Syntax assigns human emotion to location.

### Fragmentary Elaboration
"Full of a baby's venom."—**sentence fragment** without subject. Syntax breaks grammatical completeness.

### Genitive Contradiction
"a baby's venom"—**possessive with oxymoronic noun**. Syntax makes infant source of poison.

### Definite Collective
"The women in the house"—**definite article** with locative phrase. Syntax makes women defined by dwelling place.

### Epistemic Verb
"knew it"—**cognitive verb** with pronoun. Syntax makes house-character's nature knowable.

### Coordinate Addition
"and so did the children"—**coordinating conjunction** with inverted auxiliary. Syntax adds children's knowledge.

### Stylistic Effect
Through numerical subject 124, copulative spiteful character, fragmentary full-of elaboration, oxymoronic baby's-venom genitive, definite women-in-house, epistemic knowing, and coordinate children-too, Morrison creates syntax of haunting—grammar that makes house address into malevolent character, breaks standard sentence structure, combines infant innocence with poison, establishing supernatural presence known by all inhabitants.
