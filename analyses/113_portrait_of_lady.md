## Author and Source
**Henry James**, *The Portrait of a Lady* (1881)

## Passage
> She had wanted to see life, and fortune had favoured her in a manner which now, as she looked about her, struck her as almost grotesque. The dry staring fact was that she had a great deal of money.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to expectation.
*Example:* Fortune "favoring" her in "grotesque" manner.
*Effect:* Shows wealth as burden, not blessing.

### **Understatement** (UN-der-state-ment)
*Definition:* Minimizing importance.
*Example:* "almost grotesque" understates horror.
*Effect:* Reveals Isabel's cultivated restraint despite revulsion.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through comparison.
*Example:* "dry staring fact" - minimal description for life-changing wealth.
*Effect:* Reduces dramatic change to blunt reality.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Past Perfect Desire
"She had wanted to see life"—**past perfect** marks earlier ambition. Syntax creates temporal distance from naive desire.

### Personified Abstract
"fortune had favoured her"—**subject "fortune" as agent**. Syntax removes human agency, makes wealth seem fated.

### Relative Clause Realization
"which now...struck her as almost grotesque"—**relative clause** with temporal adverb and verb of perception. Syntax performs belated recognition.

### Temporal Participle
"as she looked about her"—**temporal subordinate** with reflexive. Syntax makes recognition simultaneous with surveying.

### Emphatic "dry staring fact"
"The dry staring fact"—**definite article with two modifying adjectives**. Syntax makes reality un-ignorable through personification.

### Copulative Revelation
"was that she had"—**copula followed by noun clause**. Syntax delivers revelation in subordinate clause.

### Quantitative Understatement
"a great deal of money"—**indefinite article** with vague quantifier. Syntax refuses to specify exact amount, maintaining genteel vagueness.

### Stylistic Effect
Through past perfect marking naive earlier desire, ironic personification of fortune, belated recognition in relative clause, and understated "dry staring fact," James creates syntax of disillusionment—grammar that reveals wealth's grotesque power through restrained, indirect articulation.
