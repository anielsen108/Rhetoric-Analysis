# Passage 091: "White Noise"

## Author and Source
**Don DeLillo**, *White Noise* (1985)

## Passage
> The smoke alarm went off in the hallway upstairs, either to let us know the battery had just died or because the house was on fire. We finished our coffee in a leisurely way before we went to check.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "battery had just died" vs. "house was on fire"
*Effect:* Juxtaposes trivial and catastrophic with equal weight.

### **Understatement** (UN-der-state-ment)
*Definition:* Minimizing importance.
*Example:* "finished our coffee in a leisurely way" before checking alarm.
*Effect:* Creates deadpan humor; shows numbness to danger.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* (Implied: not urgently, not worried).
*Effect:* Suggests modern detachment from crisis.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Disjunctive Either/Or
"either to let us know...or because"—**correlative conjunction** presenting two vastly different possibilities. Syntax treats trivial and catastrophic as equivalent options.

### Past Perfect
"battery had just died"—**past perfect** emphasizes completion. "Just" intensifier suggests recentness, minimizing seriousness.

### Contrastive Tense
"house was on fire"—**past progressive** makes ongoing disaster seem merely descriptive. Syntax neutralizes emergency through matter-of-fact tone.

### Temporal Before-Clause
"before we went to check"—**subordinate temporal clause**. Syntax prioritizes coffee completion over safety investigation.

### Manner Adverbial
"in a leisurely way"—**prepositional phrase of manner**. Syntax emphasizes unhurried pace despite potential catastrophe.

### Stylistic Effect
Through disjunctive equal treatment of trivial/catastrophic, matter-of-fact progressive tense for fire, and temporal subordination that prioritizes coffee, DeLillo creates syntax of postmodern numbness—grammar that can't distinguish emergency from routine.
