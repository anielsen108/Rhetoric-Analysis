# Passage 091: Alarm Fatigue (*White Noise*)

**Don DeLillo** · *White Noise* · 1985 | Smoke alarm passage

**Occasion/Pressure:** Expose suburban family’s desensitization to threat via absurd calm when alarm sounds.
**Persona/Stance:** Deadpan first-person narrator chronicling domestic routine.
**Thesis of Effect:** Correlative either/or structure and leisurely pacing render disaster and inconvenience indistinguishable, satirizing postmodern numbness.

## PASSAGE

[L1] The smoke alarm went off in the hallway upstairs, either to let us know the battery had just died or because the house was on fire.
[L2] We finished our coffee in a leisurely way before we went to check.

---

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Antithesis**
**Evidence:** "battery had just died" vs. "house was on fire."
**Effect:** Pits trivial annoyance against catastrophe with equal weight.

### **Understatement**
**Evidence:** "finished our coffee in a leisurely way."
**Effect:** Downplays urgency, creating dark comedy.

### **Situational irony**
**Evidence:** Calm response to possible fire.
**Effect:** Highlights characters’ sensory overload and denial.

### **Bathos**
**Evidence:** Shift from life-threatening to mundane battery issue.
**Effect:** Collapses high stakes into banal domesticity.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Correlative conjunction**
**Evidence:** "either…or…"
**Effect:** Balances two outcomes as grammatically equivalent.

### **Past perfect vs. past progressive**
**Evidence:** "had just died" vs. "was on fire."
**Effect:** One completed minor event weighed against ongoing disaster.

### **Temporal subordination**
**Evidence:** "before we went to check."
**Effect:** Coffee ritual prioritized over safety.

### **Adverbial prepositional phrase**
**Evidence:** "in a leisurely way."
**Effect:** Adds languid cadence to anticlimactic action.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Paratactic calm**
**Signals:** Declarative sentences without exclamation or modal.
**Effect:** Mirrors media-saturated detachment.

### **Deadpan pacing**
**Signals:** Long first sentence, short second.
**Effect:** Draws out absurd choice then resolves with blasé action.

### **Narrative deflation**
**Signals:** Tone that refuses drama.
**Effect:** Critiques consumer-era complacency.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Soft consonants (leisurely, coffee) cushion alarm vocabulary.

**Cadence:** L1 meanders through clauses; L2 clipped, finishing gesture.

**Music:** Like alarm beeping then being silenced by routine sip.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** L1 = simple clause expanded by correlative phrase; L2 = simple sentence with preposed subject and trailing temporal clause.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** None; subject-verb lead.
- **Mid:** "either…or" splits predicate.
- **Postposed:** Temporal clause delays action until coffee finished.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Coordination via correlative; subordination via "before" clause.

**Information flow:** Alarm event → two competing explanations → indulgent delay → eventual action.

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"The smoke alarm went off. We kept drinking coffee before checking."* — Loses satirical balance.
- **Dilated:** *"The upstairs smoke alarm began shrilling, perhaps merely to report a dead battery, perhaps because the entire house was burning, yet we lingered over coffee before seeing which it was."* — Preserves irony with added flourish.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deixis:** "The" assumes shared domestic space; "we" invites reader into family unit.

**Aspect:** Past perfect marks completed battery death; past progressive envisions ongoing blaze.

**Modality:** Absence of modal verbs underscores flat certainty.

**Temporal logic:** Alarm now; response delayed by ritual, exposing skewed priorities.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:** Technology as unreliable guardian; domestic comfort vs. latent danger.

**Lexical fields:** Safety devices, household routines, time management.

**Image logic:** Modern life frames emergencies as notifications on par with appliance upkeep.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** First-person narrator summarizing family behavior.

**Time:** Real-time incident compressed to two sentences.

**Beat structure:** Alarm sounds → possibilities weighed → coffee finished → eventual check implied.

**Subtext:** Constant exposure to warnings breeds paralysis; consumer comforts trump survival instincts.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Observational authority derived from steady voice amid chaos.

**Pathos:** Frustrated empathy for family oblivious to danger.

**Logos:** Syntax logically equates two scenarios to demonstrate cultural confusion.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Absurdist domestic fiction:** Resonates with Barthelme’s deadpan scenarios.

**Satirical suburbia:** Kin to Updike’s portraits of comfortable malaise.

**Media critique:** Anticipates David Foster Wallace’s observations on overstimulation.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"either…battery…or because the house was on fire"** — comedic juxtaposition.
2. **"finished our coffee"** — reveals skewed priorities.
3. **"in a leisurely way"** — final twist of irony.

### Faultlines
- Reader anxiety vs. narrator calm creates tension.
- Unclear resolution underscores perpetual low-grade dread.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove "in a leisurely way"—irony weakens considerably.

**Amplification test:** Describe aroma of coffee—could slow pacing, but might heighten contrast.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"The alarm sounded upstairs, either to announce a depleted battery or to indicate the house was aflame. We concluded our coffee at a measured pace before investigating."*
- **Colloquial:** *"The smoke alarm blared upstairs—maybe the battery croaked, maybe the house was burning. We wrapped up our coffee, no rush, before checking."*

**Punctuation swap:** Replace comma before "either" with semicolon; would stiffen flow, reduce conversational ease.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *The carbon monoxide detector chirped in the garage, either to nag us about low batteries or because fumes were pooling. We tidied the dishes before we went to look.*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *The alarm went off so we ran outside.* — Removes satire.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *The smoke alarm sounded—maybe a dead battery, maybe fire. We finished coffee before checking.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Use correlative structures to equate wildly different outcomes.
2. Pair emergency with domestic comfort to critique complacency.
3. Deploy understatement to make satire bite.
4. Let sentence length reflect emotional response (long speculation, short action).
5. Highlight rituals (coffee) as shields against anxiety.
6. Keep narrator calm to intensify reader alarm.
7. End on delayed response to underscore theme of inaction.
