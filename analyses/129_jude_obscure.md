# Passage 129: "Jude the Obscure"

## Author and Source
**Thomas Hardy**, *Jude the Obscure* (1895)

## Passage
> The boy stood with his back to the rick, and his eyes fixed on the far horizon, as if he could discern there, in the vast expanse, some promise of happier times; and perhaps he could, for such minds are often the victims of their own imagination.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to surface.
*Example:* "perhaps he could" immediately undercut by "victims of their own imagination"
*Effect:* Narrator simultaneously validates and condemns hope.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "promise...happier times" vs. "victims...imagination"
*Effect:* Creates tension between hope and delusion.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Horizon as bearer of "promise"
*Effect:* Makes landscape repository of hope.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Compound Prepositional Phrases
"with his back to the rick, and his eyes fixed on"—**two parallel prepositional phrases**. Syntax establishes physical position.

### Passive Participle
"eyes fixed"—**passive participle** shows involuntary stare. Syntax emphasizes compulsion.

### Conditional Clause
"as if he could discern"—**comparative conditional** expressing hypothesis. Syntax performs narrator's speculation.

### Locative Specification
"there, in the vast expanse"—**demonstrative with appositive**. Syntax emphasizes emptiness of where hope is projected.

### Abstract Object
"some promise of happier times"—**indefinite quantifier** with abstract noun. Syntax makes hope vague, uncertain.

### Adversative Possibility
"and perhaps he could"—**coordinating conjunction** with modal. Syntax seems to validate vision.

### Causal Reversal
"for such minds are often the victims"—**causal clause** that undermines preceding possibility. Syntax performs Hardy's fatalism.

### Genitive Agency
"of their own imagination"—**genitive** makes imagination the victimizer. Syntax makes hope itself dangerous.

### Stylistic Effect
Through conditional speculation, adversative possibility immediately undercut by causal fatalism, passive fixation, and genitive making imagination victimizer, Hardy creates syntax of cosmic irony—grammar that simultaneously grants and revokes hope, performing narrator's position above and beyond character's delusions.
