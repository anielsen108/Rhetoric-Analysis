# Passage 087: "Things Fall Apart"

## Author and Source
**Chinua Achebe**, *Things Fall Apart* (1958)

## Passage
> Okonkwo was well known throughout the nine villages and even beyond. His fame rested on solid personal achievements.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* Not used here, but note direct assertion instead.
*Effect:* Achebe uses direct statement, refusing Western ironic distance.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* "well known throughout the nine villages and even beyond"
*Effect:* Establishes Okonkwo's heroic stature in Igbo terms.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Fame "rested on" achievements (as foundation supports building).
*Effect:* Makes reputation architectural, built on concrete actions.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Passive Construction
"was well known"—**passive voice** with adverbial intensifier. Syntax emphasizes the state of being known rather than who knows him.

### Spatial Extension
"throughout the nine villages and even beyond"—**prepositional phrase** with **intensifying conjunction** "even." Syntax expands reputation geographically.

### Active Verb of Foundation
"His fame rested on"—**active verb of position** with prepositional object. Syntax makes fame architectural, founded on something solid.

### Adjectival Modification
"solid personal achievements"—**two adjectives** modify noun. "Solid" suggests substance; "personal" emphasizes individual agency.

### Stylistic Effect
Through passive voice establishing reputation, spatial expansion, and metaphor of architectural foundation, Achebe creates syntax of earned heroic status—grammar that validates achievement in Igbo cultural terms before colonial disruption.
