# Passage 109: "Underground Man"

## Author and Source
**Fyodor Dostoevsky**, *Notes from Underground* (1864, translated from Russian)

## Passage
> I am a sick man... I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is diseased. However, I know nothing at all about my disease, and do not know for certain what ails me.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "I am...I am...I am"
*Effect:* Hammers identity through insistent repetition.

### **Epistrophe** (ee-PIS-truh-fee)
*Definition:* Repetition at end.
*Example:* Repeated "man" at clause ends.
*Effect:* Emphasizes damaged humanity.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Self-contradictory statement.
*Example:* "I believe...However, I know nothing"
*Effect:* Shows self-defeating consciousness.

### **Correctio** (kor-REK-tee-oh)
*Definition:* Self-correction.
*Example:* Statement followed by "However" retraction.
*Effect:* Enacts the self-undermining consciousness of narrator.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Serial Copulative Declarations
"I am...I am...I am"—**three parallel copula constructions**. Syntax builds identity through accumulation of negative qualities.

### Adjective Escalation
"sick...spiteful...unattractive"—**three adjectives** of increasing specificity. Syntax moves from physical to moral to aesthetic.

### Adversative Pivot
"However"—**strong adversative conjunction**. Syntax reverses previous assertion.

### Double Negation
"know nothing at all"—**negative with intensifier**. Syntax emphasizes complete ignorance.

### Parallel Negative Clauses
"know nothing...do not know"—**two negative epistemic verbs**. Syntax doubles uncertainty.

### Modal Uncertainty
"do not know for certain"—**negated certainty**. Syntax makes even uncertainty uncertain.

### Indirect Question
"what ails me"—**embedded question** without answer. Syntax leaves diagnosis open.

### Stylistic Effect
Through anaphoric self-definition, adversative self-contradiction, doubled negation, and embedded unanswered question, Dostoevsky creates syntax of hyper-consciousness—grammar of the underground man's self-defeating, endlessly reflexive thought.
