# Passage 171: "White Noise"

## Author and Source
**Don DeLillo**, *White Noise* (1985)

## Passage
> The supermarket shelves have been rearranged. It happened one day, without warning. There is agitation and panic in the aisles, dismay in the faces of older shoppers.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* "agitation and panic" over shelf rearrangement.
*Effect:* Satirizes consumer culture's trivial anxieties.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "in the aisles...in the faces"
*Effect:* Maps emotional geography of supermarket.

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh)
*Definition:* Verb governing different objects.
*Example:* Existential "There is" governing both "agitation" and "dismay"
*Effect:* Links abstract emotions to physical locations.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Passive Rearrangement
"The supermarket shelves have been rearranged"—**present perfect passive**. Syntax removes agency from change.

### Temporal Vagueness
"one day"—**indefinite temporal phrase**. Syntax refuses specificity about when.

### Prepositional Condition
"without warning"—**negative prepositional phrase**. Syntax emphasizes suddenness.

### Existential Construction
"There is agitation and panic"—**existential subject**. Syntax presents emotions as environmental conditions.

### Coordinate Emotions
"agitation and panic"—**two nouns coordinated**. Syntax escalates from unease to fear.

### Locative Prepositional
"in the aisles"—**spatial preposition**. Syntax places emotion geographically.

### Parallel Existential
"dismay in the faces"—**elliptical second existential**. Syntax continues emotional mapping.

### Genitive Specificity
"of older shoppers"—**possessive specifying group**. Syntax identifies who suffers most.

### Stylistic Effect
Through passive rearrangement removing agency, vague one-day timing, negative without-warning, existential there-is construction, escalating agitation-and-panic coordination, spatial in-aisles/in-faces mapping, and genitive older-shoppers specification, DeLillo creates syntax of postmodern dislocation—grammar that treats consumer disruption with language of catastrophe, satirizing how loss of familiar brands generates existential crisis.
