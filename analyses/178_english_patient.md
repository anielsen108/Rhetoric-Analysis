# Passage 178: "The English Patient"

## Author and Source
**Michael Ondaatje**, *The English Patient* (1992)

## Passage
> She stands up in the garden where she has been working and looks into the distance. She has sensed a shift in the weather. There is another gust of wind, a buckle of noise in the air, and the tall cypresses sway.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Wind as "buckle of noise"
*Effect:* Makes sound into physical fold or fastening.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Weather capable of being "sensed" as shifting entity.
*Effect:* Makes atmospheric change into sentient presence.

### **Synesthesia** (sin-es-THEE-zhuh)
*Definition:* Mixing sensory modes.
*Example:* "buckle of noise" - tactile metaphor for auditory experience.
*Effect:* Blends touch and sound into unified sensation.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Intransitive Rising
"She stands up"—**phrasal verb** of motion. Syntax shows vertical movement.

### Prepositional Location
"in the garden"—**spatial preposition** with definite article. Syntax establishes outdoor setting.

### Relative Clause Background
"where she has been working"—**locative relative** with present perfect progressive. Syntax provides prior context.

### Coordinate Looking
"and looks into the distance"—**coordinating conjunction** with prepositional vision. Syntax adds observation to rising.

### Present Perfect Sensing
"has sensed"—**present perfect**. Syntax shows completed perception with present relevance.

### Indefinite Shift
"a shift in the weather"—**indefinite article** with abstract noun. Syntax makes change non-specific but palpable.

### Existential There
"There is another gust"—**existential construction**. Syntax announces wind's arrival.

### Appositive Metaphor
"a buckle of noise"—**appositive phrase** with unusual genitive. Syntax adds synesthetic description.

### Prepositional Medium
"in the air"—**locative preposition**. Syntax situates sound in atmosphere.

### Coordinate Swaying
"and the tall cypresses sway"—**coordinating conjunction** with intransitive verb. Syntax adds trees' response to wind.

### Adjectival Height
"tall cypresses"—**adjective emphasizing vertical**. Syntax makes trees' elevation significant.

### Stylistic Effect
Through intransitive standing-up, relative where-working background, present perfect sensing, existential there-is announcement, appositive buckle-of-noise synesthesia, and coordinate tall-cypresses-swaying, Ondaatje creates syntax of attentive stillness—grammar that moves from human rising and sensing to environmental response, connecting character to landscape through accumulated sensory details.
