# Passage 018: The Sun Also Rises

## Author and Source
**Ernest Hemingway**, *The Sun Also Rises* (1926), Book II, Chapter 14

## Passage
> The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed directly below us. He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to. He profiled directly in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-ton)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions between related clauses.
*Example:* Short declarative sentences placed side by side without connectives.
*Effect:* Creates staccato rhythm; each action stands alone, clear and distinct.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition of ideas.
*Example:* "not as he had been forced to...but as he wanted to"
*Effect:* Emphasizes Romero's agency and artistry; contrasts compulsion with choice.

### **Polysyndeton** (pol-ee-SIN-duh-ton)
*Definition:* Multiple conjunctions in close succession.
*Example:* "profiled...and drew...and sighted"—three actions linked by "and"
*Effect:* Slows down the action; makes us experience each step of the ritual.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Substitution of attribute for thing meant.
*Example:* "the blade" for the sword
*Effect:* Focuses attention on the killing implement; makes it concrete and specific.

### **Understatement** (UN-der-state-ment)
*Definition:* Deliberate restraint in expression.
*Example:* "to be killed"—passive, matter-of-fact phrasing for violent death.
*Effect:* Creates emotional restraint characteristic of Hemingway; implies stoicism.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Statement
"The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed"—this **passive construction** opens with the bull as grammatical subject but not as agent. The syntax uses **"was squared"**—passive voice of an intransitive verb made transitive, suggesting the bull has positioned itself (or been positioned) properly.

The phrase **"on all four feet"** provides concrete physical detail. The syntax doesn't abstract or metaphorize—it reports the physical reality: four feet, squared (balanced, positioned).

The **infinitive phrase "to be killed"** expresses purpose but uses passive voice. The syntax doesn't name the killer yet—the bull "was...to be killed," as if by fate or ritual necessity rather than human agency.

This **passivity** is strategic: the syntax presents the bull's death as inevitable, necessary, almost natural—the bull is positioned "to be killed" as one might be positioned "to pose" or "to rest."

### Subject-Verb-Adverb Simplicity
"and Romero killed directly below us"—after the passive opening, we get **active voice**: Romero killed. The syntax is subject-verb-adverb, stripped to essentials.

The verb **"killed"** is unmodified, unqualified. Not "killed the bull," not "killed cleanly" or "killed perfectly"—just "killed." The syntax makes the verb absolute through omission of object (we know what he killed from context).

The adverbial phrase **"directly below us"** locates the action spatially. The word "directly" serves double duty: spatially (immediately below) and evaluatively (straightforwardly, properly). The syntax compresses spatial and moral judgment into one word.

The **first-person plural "us"** suddenly introduces the narrator and spectators. The syntax has moved from bull (object/victim) through Romero (agent) to observers (witnesses). This progression establishes the triangular relationship of bullfighting: bull, fighter, crowd.

### Contrastive Structure
"He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to"—this sentence uses the **"not...but" correlative structure** to create antithesis. The syntax is carefully balanced:
- not as [he had been forced to by the last bull]
- but as [he wanted to]

The **negative clause** comes first, establishing what this killing is NOT, before stating what it IS. This syntactic prioritization of the negative emphasizes the contrast—we must understand the previous failure to appreciate the current success.

### Passive Agent Construction
"as he had been forced to by the last bull"—this **subordinate clause** uses passive voice ("had been forced") with the agent expressed in a prepositional phrase ("by the last bull"). The syntax makes Romero the grammatical subject but not the true agent—the last bull forced him.

The **past perfect tense** ("had been forced") indicates this is prior to the main action. The syntax maintains strict temporal clarity.

The phrase **"by the last bull"** is significant—not "by circumstances" or "by the bull's behavior" but by the bull itself as agent. The syntax grants agency to the animal.

### Active Agency
"but as he wanted to"—the **coordinate clause** contrasts sharply with the previous passive construction. Here Romero is both grammatical subject and true agent. The syntax emphasizes volition through the **verb "wanted"** (desire/will).

The **infinitive "to"** stands alone, with the full verb ("to kill") elided. This syntactic ellipsis creates elegance and also makes "wanted to" feel more absolute—not just wanting to kill but wanting to (in general), having will and agency.

### Compound Predicate
"He profiled directly in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade"—this sentence has **one subject ("He") with three coordinate verbs**:
- profiled
- drew
- sighted

This **compound predicate** structure presents three actions in sequence, linked by commas and final "and." The syntax creates what Tufte calls **accumulation through coordination**—each action adds to the previous, building toward the moment of killing (which will come in the next sentence, not quoted here).

### Technical Vocabulary
The syntax incorporates **bullfighting terminology** without explanation:
- "profiled" (positioned in profile)
- "muleta" (red cloth)

These technical terms are embedded naturally in the syntax. There's no parenthetical explanation, no subordinate clause defining terms. The syntax assumes knowledge or expects readers to infer from context.

### Prepositional Precision
Notice the **prepositional phrases** that specify each action:
- "directly in front of the bull" (position)
- "out of the folds of the muleta" (source/location)
- "along the blade" (direction of sight)

Each verb receives spatial specification. The syntax is concrete and visual—we can picture each position and movement. This is Hemingway's famous "iceberg theory" in action: the syntax shows the physical surface while emotional depth remains submerged.

### Parallel Structure
The three verbs create **parallel structure**:
- [verb] + [prepositional phrase]
- [verb] + [prepositional phrase]
- [verb] + [prepositional phrase]

This **isocolon** (parallel clauses of similar length and structure) creates ritual quality. The syntax enacts the formal, ceremonial nature of bullfighting.

### Simple Past Tense
All verbs use **simple past tense**:
- was squared
- killed
- had been forced
- wanted
- profiled
- drew
- sighted

The syntax maintains consistent temporal frame. There's no progressive aspect ("was profiling"), no perfect constructions beyond the one necessary for showing prior action ("had been forced"). The **simple past** creates directness and immediacy despite being past tense.

### Absence of Modification
Note what the syntax **excludes**:
- No adjectives (except in technical terms like "last bull")
- No adverbs (except "directly")
- No subordinate clauses providing psychological insight
- No metaphors or similes
- No qualification or hedging

This **syntactic minimalism** is Hemingway's signature. The prose is stripped to subjects, verbs, and essential prepositional phrases.

### Sentence Length
The three sentences progress in length:
1. "The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed directly below us." (17 words)
2. "He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to." (18 words)
3. "He profiled directly in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade." (23 words)

The **syntactic expansion** builds momentum. Each sentence is longer than the previous, creating accumulation toward the climactic moment (the actual kill, not shown in this excerpt).

### Coordination vs. Subordination
The passage heavily favors **coordination** over subordination. Even when subordinate clauses appear ("as he had been forced to"), they're part of coordinate structures ("not...but"). The syntax avoids complex embedding, maintaining what Tufte calls **paratactic clarity**.

This syntactic choice creates the famous "Hemingway style"—sentences that seem simple but achieve complex effects through juxtaposition and implication rather than explicit subordination.

### Repetition
The word **"killed"** appears twice in close proximity:
- "to be killed"
- "Romero killed"
- "He killed"

This **lexical repetition** with **syntactic variation** (passive infinitive, active transitive, active transitive again) emphasizes the central action. The syntax doesn't shy from the blunt word; Hemingway refuses euphemism.

### Subject Variation
The subjects vary systematically:
- "The bull" (victim)
- "Romero" (agent, by name)
- "He" (agent, by pronoun)
- "he" (agent, continued)
- "He" (agent, continued)

The **shift from noun to pronoun** after naming Romero maintains focus on the matador while varying syntax. The capitalization of "He" at sentence beginnings gives the pronoun unusual emphasis.

### Stylistic Effect
Through simple declarative sentences, minimal modification, and concrete diction, Hemingway creates his signature style—prose that appears simple while conveying complex meaning through implication and juxtaposition. The syntax performs the "grace under pressure" the passage describes: controlled, precise, economical, with no wasted motion in either the bullfighter's actions or the writer's sentences.

As Tufte emphasizes, this is **syntax as philosophy**—the stripped-down structures embody a worldview. The refusal of psychological language, the preference for concrete action, the coordination rather than subordination, the repetition without variation of simple verbs—all of this creates what we recognize as "Hemingway prose." The syntax doesn't just describe stoicism and craft; it enacts them. The form IS the code—the values Hemingway's characters try to live by are embedded in the structure of his sentences. This is syntax as ethics, style as stance toward life.
