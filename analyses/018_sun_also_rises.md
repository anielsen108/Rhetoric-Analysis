# Passage 018: The Sun Also Rises

**Ernest Hemingway** · *The Sun Also Rises* · 1926 | Bullfight scene, Book II

**Occasion/Pressure:** Climactic moment in bullfight narrative; must convey ritual significance and technical mastery without sentimentality.
**Persona/Stance:** First-person witness; voice performs restrained observation, concealing emotion beneath reportorial surface.
**Thesis of Effect:** Paratactic syntax strips action to elemental verbs—coordinate clauses without subordination enact Hemingway's "code": grace under pressure performed through linguistic economy.

## PASSAGE

[L1] The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed directly
[L2] below us. He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted
[L3] to. He profiled directly in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the
[L4] muleta and sighted along the blade.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez / ˈlaɪtətiːz)
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Deliberate understatement, often through double negative or restrained expression.
**Evidence:** "The bull was squared...to be killed"—passive voice understates violent death. "He killed"—no modifiers, no drama.
**Effect:** Hemingway's signature restraint. The bullfight's violence and meaning buried beneath flat diction. Reader must infer significance from what's not said.
**Near-miss:** Not meiosis (simple understatement): litotes specifically involves negation or conspicuous restraint.
**Risk:** Could seem emotionally dead, robotic. Here, restraint creates tension—we feel what's withheld.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis / ænˈtɪθəsɪs)
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Balanced opposition of contrasting ideas.
**Evidence:** "not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to"—correlative structure sets compulsion against volition.
**Effect:** The syntax performs the contrast: failure vs. success, coercion vs. agency. Reader understands Romero's mastery through grammatical balance.
**Near-miss:** Not paradox (apparent contradiction revealing truth): this is genuine opposition, not reconciliation.
**Risk:** Could feel too neat, schematic. Hemingway's plain diction keeps it from feeling rhetorical.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee / məˈtɒnəmi)
**Lines:** L3-4
**Definition:** Substitution of associated attribute for thing meant.
**Evidence:** "the blade" (stands for sword as killing instrument); "the muleta" (Spanish term for specific red cloth, standing for bullfighter's technique/art).
**Effect:** Technical vocabulary creates insider knowledge. Reader either knows bullfighting or infers from context. The specificity grants authority.
**Near-miss:** Not synecdoche (part for whole): metonymy uses association, not part-whole relationship.
**Risk:** Untranslated Spanish could alienate readers. Hemingway trusts context to convey meaning.

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-ton / əˈsɪndətɒn)
**Lines:** L3-4
**Definition:** Omission of expected conjunctions between coordinate elements.
**Evidence:** "He profiled...drew...and sighted"—first two verbs connected only by comma, final "and" delayed.
**Effect:** First two actions blur together—rapid sequence. Final "and" slows for climactic sight-line. Reader experiences varied pace within single sentence.
**Near-miss:** Not quite polysyndeton (which would add ands): this is mixed—omission then single conjunction.
**Risk:** Could feel syntactically inconsistent. Here it creates rhythm variation.

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh / ˈzuːɡmə)
**Lines:** L2-3
**Definition:** One verb governing multiple objects or complements in different senses.
**Evidence:** "as he wanted to"—"wanted" governs both volition (desire) and method (technique). The elliptical "to" implies "to kill" but also "to be" (his authentic self).
**Effect:** Compression. "Wanted to" carries both technical and existential meaning—right method and right being.
**Near-miss:** Not syllepsis (grammatically incompatible objects): here the ambiguity enriches meaning.
**Risk:** Ellipsis could confuse. Hemingway trusts readers to supply missing verb.

### **Anastrophe** (uh-NAS-truh-fee / əˈnæstrəfi)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Inversion of natural word order.
**Evidence:** "The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed"—normal order would be "The bull squared itself on all four feet to be killed."
**Effect:** Passive voice creates fatalism. Bull positioned by fate/ritual, not by own agency. Reader experiences death as inevitable, ceremonial.
**Near-miss:** Not hyperbaton (elaborate poetic inversion): this is functional, not ornamental.
**Risk:** Passive voice can weaken prose. Here it's strategic—bull as object, not agent.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Parataxis** (PAIR-uh-TAK-sis / ˌpærəˈtæksɪs)
**Lines:** L1-4
**Definition:** Coordination of clauses without subordination; flat logical plane.
**Evidence:** "The bull was squared...and Romero killed...He killed...He profiled...drew...and sighted"—independent clauses joined by "and," minimal subordination.
**Effect:** Hemingway's signature style. Events sit side-by-side without explicit causal links. Reader supplies the "because" and "therefore." Syntax enacts stoic observation.
**Risk:** Can feel choppy, primitive, or affectless. Hemingway's restraint is polarizing—some readers find it profound, others empty.

### **Polysyndeton** (PAH-lee-SIN-duh-ton / ˌpɒlɪˈsɪndətɒn)
**Lines:** L3-4
**Definition:** Use of multiple conjunctions in close succession.
**Evidence:** "He profiled...drew...and sighted"—three verbs, one "and," creating accumulation toward climax.
**Effect:** Slows reading at crucial moment. The three actions build ceremonially. Reader experiences ritual preparation.
**Risk:** Could drag if overused. Here, limited to climactic sentence, so creates emphasis.

### **Isocolon** (eye-SOH-kuh-lon / aɪˈsɒkəlɒn)
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Parallel clauses of similar length and structure.
**Evidence:** "not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to"—balanced clauses (9 words, then 5 words).
**Effect:** Syntactic balance emphasizes semantic opposition. The symmetry makes the contrast feel inevitable, natural.
**Risk:** Perfect balance can feel artificial. Hemingway's plain diction naturalizes it.

### **Epizeuxis** (ep-ih-ZOOK-sis / ˌɛpɪˈzuːksɪs)
**Lines:** L1-2
**Definition:** Immediate repetition of word for emphasis.
**Evidence:** "killed...killed...He killed"—the verb appears three times in rapid succession.
**Effect:** No euphemism, no evasion. The blunt word repeated establishes this is killing, not "dispatching" or "finishing." Reader confronts violence beneath ritual.
**Near-miss:** Not anadiplosis (repetition linking clauses): this is pure repetition for emphasis.
**Risk:** Could feel monotonous or brutal. Hemingway refuses to soften, making the reader complicit.

### **Brachylogia** (brak-ih-LOH-jee-uh / ˌbrækɪˈloʊdʒiə)
**Lines:** L1-4
**Definition:** Abbreviated expression; omitting expected words.
**Evidence:** "He killed directly below us"—no object stated (we know it's the bull). "as he wanted to"—verb omitted after "to."
**Effect:** Extreme compression. Hemingway omits anything inferable from context. Reader actively fills gaps, becoming participant.
**Risk:** Excessive abbreviation can confuse. Hemingway's context makes omissions clear.

### **Diacope** (dy-AK-uh-pee / daɪˈækəpi)
**Lines:** L1-4
**Definition:** Repetition of word with intervening words between instances.
**Evidence:** "directly" appears twice (L1, L3)—"directly below us," "directly in front of the bull."
**Effect:** The adverb emphasizes precision, correctness. Both spatially (location) and morally (right method). Reader hears the value encoded in repetition.
**Risk:** Repetition can feel unintentional. Here it's clearly deliberate—key term for Hemingway's code.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Passive Voice as Thematic Device**
**Lines:** L1
**Signals:**
- "The bull was squared"—passive construction deletes agent.
- "to be killed"—passive infinitive emphasizes bull as object/patient, not agent.
**Effect on stance:** Bull is positioned by fate/ritual, not by its own action. Syntax enacts fatalism central to bullfighting ethos. Reader experiences death as necessary, formal.
**Classical kin:** Passive periphrasis, but modernist in thematic weight—voice choice carries worldview.

### **Coordinate Verbs Without Explicit Causality**
**Lines:** L1-4
**Signals:**
- "was squared...and Romero killed"—two actions joined by "and" without causal subordination.
- Paratactic accumulation: fact, fact, fact, no "because" or "therefore."
**Effect on stance:** Reader must infer causality. Syntax refuses to explain, performing the code's reticence. Events speak for themselves.
**Classical kin:** Parataxis, but modernist omission of logical connectors is Hemingway signature.

### **Subject-Verb Minimalism (Omitted Objects)**
**Lines:** L1-2
**Signals:**
- "and Romero killed"—object (the bull) omitted, inferable from context.
- "He killed"—again, object deleted.
**Effect on stance:** Extreme economy. No word wasted. Syntax enacts efficiency valued in bullfighting. Reader experiences compression as aesthetic.
**Classical kin:** Brachylogia, but modern functional grammar—information structure manages old (given) vs. new (focus).

### **Modal Auxiliary (Past Intention)**
**Lines:** L2
**Signals:**
- "as he wanted to"—modal "wanted" + infinitive marker "to" (verb omitted).
- Contrasts with "had been forced to"—obligation/compulsion vs. volition/desire.
**Effect on stance:** Modality encodes ethics. Being "forced" = failure; "wanting" = mastery. Reader learns code's values through grammar.
**Classical kin:** Volitive mood, but English uses modal auxiliaries for stance/attitude.

### **Deictic Positioning (First-Person Plural)**
**Lines:** L1
**Signals:**
- "directly below us"—first-person plural pronoun anchors perspective.
- Reader positioned as witness alongside narrator.
**Effect on stance:** We are there, in the stands, watching. Deixis creates co-presence. Reader becomes spectator, implicated in ritual.
**Classical kin:** Deictic center, but modernist use of "us" creates solidarity between narrator-reader.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** L1 opens with voiced stops: "bull...squared" (b/d sounds—solid, grounded). Then unvoiced k: "killed" (harsh, final). L2-3 shift to liquid-r's: "Romero...forced...profiled...front...drew...folds"—rolling, continuous. L4 returns to sibilants: "sighted...blade" (hissing, tense).

**Cadence seams:** Comma after "killed" (L1) is breath-pause before location marker. Period after "us" (L1-2) is hard stop—completed action. Comma after "bull" (L2) sets up antithesis. Period after "to" (L3) ends explanation, begins action-sequence. Comma after "bull" (L3) separates first verb. Comma after "muleta" (L3-4) separates second verb. Period after "blade" (L4) completes ritual preparation.

**Alliteration:** "bull...below" (b-sounds); "forced...front...folds" (f-sounds); "killed" (repeated k-sound); "sighted...sword" (s-sounds).

**Assonance:** "bull...us" (short-u); "killed...directly" (short-i); "profiled...sighted" (long-i); "drew...muleta" (oo/oo).

**Rhythm:** L1: "the BULL was SQUARED on all FOUR FEET to be KILLED, and ro-MER-o KILLED di-RECT-ly be-LOW us"—mix of iambs and trochees. L2: "he KILLED not AS he had been FORCED to BY the last BULL, but AS he WANT-ed TO"—stresses on key contrasts (not/forced vs. wanted). L3-4: "he pro-FILED di-RECT-ly in FRONT of the BULL, DREW the SWORD out OF the FOLDS of the mu-LET-a and SIGHT-ed a-LONG the BLADE"—roughly iambic with variations.

**Music argues:** The ear hears staccato opening (short clauses) expanding into ceremonial rhythm (longer final sentence). Prose moves from report to ritual. Syntax performs the bullfighter's progression from kill to preparation-for-kill.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:**
1. First sentence: Compound sentence—two independent clauses joined by "and" (passive + active).
2. Second sentence: Complex sentence with antithesis ("not...but") and embedded subordinate clause ("as he had been forced to by the last bull").
3. Third sentence: Compound predicate—one subject, three coordinate verbs.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** High coordination, minimal subordination. Only subordinate clause is comparative ("as he had been forced to"). Everything else coordinate—paratactic clarity.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Passive participle:** "was squared" (L1)—stative passive.
- **Infinitive of purpose:** "to be killed" (L1)—telic marker.
- **Prepositional phrases:** "on all four feet," "below us," "in front of the bull," "out of the folds," "of the muleta," "along the blade"—six in four lines, providing spatial precision.
- **Adverb repetition:** "directly" (L1, L3)—spatial and moral precision.

**Inversion:** Minimal. SVO order throughout except passive construction (L1) which inverts to OVS logically.

**Information flow:** Bull (given) → Romero (new agent) → method contrast (new evaluation) → specific actions (new details). Progression from general (killing) to specific (technique).

### Micro-rewrites:

**Compressed:** *"The bull stood ready. Romero killed correctly, as he'd wanted. He profiled, drew the sword from the muleta, and aimed."*
**Lost:** "squared on all four feet" (technical precision), "directly below us" (witness positioning), "by the last bull" (contrast-grounding), "folds of the muleta" (tactile detail), "sighted along the blade" (technical vocabulary). Gained: brevity, accessibility. Lost: Hemingway's authority.

**Dilated:** *"The bull had positioned itself squarely on all four of its feet in order to receive the death blow, and Romero, standing directly beneath where we sat in the stands, administered the killing stroke. He performed this action not in the manner he had been compelled to adopt by the previous bull's difficult behavior, but rather in the way he himself preferred and intended. He positioned himself in profile directly before the bull, extracted the sword from within the many folds of the red muleta cloth, and carefully aligned his vision along the length of the blade to ensure accurate aim."*
**Lost:** All compression, all restraint, all Hemingway. Subordinate clauses explain what should remain implicit. Gained: clarity for uninformed readers. Lost: the code's reticence.

**Focalization shift (omniscient):** *"The bull was ready to die, and Romero knew exactly how to kill it. He felt satisfaction that this time, unlike with the previous bull, he could perform the kill according to his art. Taking his position in profile, he drew the sword from the folds of cloth and sighted along the blade, feeling the rightness of his stance."*
**Effect:** Interior access breaks Hemingway's surface. The power of his prose is what's NOT said—feelings inferred from actions, not stated.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** "below us" (L1-2)—spatial deixis anchors narrator + reader in stands above arena. "The last bull" (L2)—temporal/referential deixis points to prior event in narrative. All verbs simple past—deictic center is retrospective narration.

**Aspect:**
- "was squared" (L1): stative passive—resultant state (bull in position).
- "to be killed" (L1): perfective infinitive—telic (goal-directed).
- "killed" (L1-2): perfective—completed action, twice.
- "had been forced" (L2): past perfect—prior event establishing contrast.
- "wanted" (L2): stative—volition, not action.
- "profiled, drew, sighted" (L3-4): perfective sequence—three completed actions.

**Modality:**
- "to be killed" (L1): deontic (necessity/requirement) + telic (purpose).
- "had been forced to" (L2): deontic (obligation imposed by circumstances).
- "wanted to" (L2): volitional (desire/intention)—contrasts with obligation.
- "profiled, drew, sighted" (L3-4): no modal marking—presented as facts, not possibilities.

**Quoted locus:** No direct speech, but "as he wanted to" (L2-3) is free indirect discourse—access to Romero's intentionality without quotation marks. Reader hears his will through narrator's report.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Positioning/Geometry:** "squared," "directly," "in front"—spatial precision as moral precision.
2. **Ritual Objects:** "muleta," "sword," "blade"—instruments of art/death.
3. **Agency/Compulsion:** "forced," "wanted"—volition vs. necessity.

**Lexical fields:**
- **Bullfighting terminology:** "squared," "muleta," "profiled," "sighted along the blade"—technical jargon establishes authority.
- **Action verbs:** "killed," "profiled," "drew," "sighted"—all concrete, physical actions.
- **Spatial prepositions:** "on," "below," "in front of," "out of," "along"—obsessive spatial specificity.

**Image logic across passage:** The bull is static (squared, positioned). Romero is dynamic (profiled, drew, sighted). The syntax mirrors the scene—immobilized animal, moving ritual-agent. Spatial prepositions map the geometry of death—everything must be aligned, "direct," correct.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** External focalization with limited internal access. We see actions (Romero killing) and infer intention ("as he wanted to"). Psychic distance fluctuates: reportorial distance (L1) momentarily closes (L2—access to will) then returns to external observation (L3-4).

**Time (Genette):**
- **Order:** Chronological with brief analepsis ("as he had been forced to by the last bull"—reference to prior bull).
- **Duration:** Scene tempo—slow motion. Four lines cover perhaps 5-10 seconds of real time. Discourse expands story-time.
- **Frequency:** Singulative (one killing told once), but contrastive with previous bull (implicitly iterative—Romero has killed many bulls).

**Beat structure:** Positioning (L1) → Evaluation (L2) → Ritual preparation (L3-4). The passage stops before the actual sword-thrust—we get the approach, not the climax. Hemingway withholds, leaving reader in suspense.

**Subtext:** Why emphasize "as he wanted to"? Implies artistic integrity, autonomy. Why "directly below us"? Positions narrator (and reader) as witness, judge. Why stop before thrust? Maximum tension—we know it's coming, don't see it yet. The restraint is erotics of delayed gratification.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Narrator establishes authority through technical vocabulary ("muleta," "profiled," "sighted along the blade") and insider positioning ("directly below us"—we're present). Reader trusts witness who knows bullfighting's language.

**Pathos:** Emotion deeply buried. No explicit affect, but tension created through contrast ("not as he had been forced...but as he wanted"), through spatial precision (everything aligned), through verb repetition ("killed" three times). Reader feels withheld emotion as pressure beneath surface.

**Logos:** Implicit argument: Romero's kill is better because autonomous ("as he wanted to"). The antithesis structures a value-judgment. Reader accepts that volition = mastery through syntactic parallelism.

**Lines:** "He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to" (L2-3)—the sentence structures an ethic: forced action is failure, chosen action is success. This IS the code Hemingway values.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Stephen Crane's *The Red Badge of Courage*:** Spare prose, short sentences, external focalization. Hemingway strips Crane's style further—even less interiority, more compression.

**Gertrude Stein's repetition:** Hemingway's mentor. "He killed...killed...He killed" echoes Stein's iterative style. But Hemingway uses repetition for emphasis, not meditative circularity.

**Biblical parataxis:** Gospel prose—short declarative sentences, coordinate clauses. "And Romero killed." The "and" is Biblical. Hemingway secularizes religious syntax for ritual of bullfight.

**Anderson's *Winesburg, Ohio*:** Plain American diction, psychological restraint. Hemingway inherits Anderson's surface simplicity hiding depth.

**Subversion:** Hemingway takes 19th-century realism's omniscience and refuses it. Where Flaubert or Tolstoy would enter Romero's consciousness, Hemingway stays outside. The refusal of interiority IS the modernist move—consciousness only through action, never explained.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots:
1. **"as he wanted to"** (L2-3)—Entire sentence builds to these four words. The elliptical "to" (verb omitted) makes the phrase both specific (wanted to kill this way) and general (wanted to be this kind of person). Reader confronts ethics encoded in volition.
2. **"killed...killed...He killed"** (L1-2)—Triple repetition refuses euphemism. Word is harsh, monosyllabic, Anglo-Saxon. Hemingway won't say "dispatched" or "finished"—the bluntness is moral honesty.
3. **"directly"** (L1, L3)—Repeated adverb carries double meaning: spatially precise AND morally correct. The word condenses Hemingway's code: do things the right way, in the right place.

### Faultlines:
1. **Passive voice** (L1)—"The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed." **Risk:** Passive voice is often weak, evasive. Here it's strategic, but some readers/writers might flag it as violation of "show don't tell" or "prefer active voice." **Defense:** The passivity is thematic—bull is object, not agent, in this ritual. Syntax enacts fate.
2. **Untranslated Spanish** ("muleta")—**Risk:** Readers unfamiliar with bullfighting may not know what a muleta is. Hemingway doesn't translate or explain. **Defense:** Context makes clear it's cloth/fabric. The untranslated word grants authority, assumes educated readership. But it's exclusionary.
3. **Extreme compression**—"He killed" (no object stated). **Risk:** Could confuse—killed what? **Defense:** Context is clear. But Hemingway's omissions require active readership. Some find this exhilarating; others find it withholding.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

### Subtraction test:
**Remove:** "directly" (both instances)
**Result:** "The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed below us. He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to. He profiled in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade."
**Loss:** The key evaluative term vanishes. Without "directly," we lose spatial precision and moral precision. The word is load-bearing—it encodes the code's central value: correctness, no deviation. Its absence makes prose purely reportorial, not ethical.

### Amplification test:
**Heighten:** Add explicit interiority
**Result:** "The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero, feeling a surge of satisfaction, killed directly below us. He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull—that had been shameful—but as he wanted to, with pride. He profiled directly in front of the bull, feeling the rightness of his stance, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade with perfect confidence."
**Gain:** Emotional clarity. **Risk:** Total violation of Hemingway's code. The stated feelings ("satisfaction," "pride," "confidence") destroy the power of restraint. What's felt must be inferred from action, never named.

### Register shift (formal ↔ colloquial):
**Formal:** "The bull had positioned itself squarely upon all four extremities in preparation for the culminating blow, and Romero administered said blow directly beneath our vantage point. He performed this action not in the manner to which he had been compelled by the previous bovine, but rather in accordance with his own volition. He assumed a profile stance directly anterior to the bull, extracted the sword from the folds of the muleta cloth, and aligned his visual axis along the weapon's blade."
**Effect:** Becomes Victorian, pompous, ridiculous. Latinate diction ("extremities," "culminating," "anterior") kills Hemingway's Anglo-Saxon directness.

**Colloquial:** "The bull was set up right for the kill, and Romero killed him right below where we sat. He didn't kill like he'd had to with the last bull, but the way he wanted. He turned sideways right in front of the bull, pulled the sword out of the cloth, and looked down the blade."
**Effect:** Contemporary American informal. Gains accessibility; loses Hemingway's careful balance between plain and formal. "Set up," "right," "pulled" are too casual—"squared," "directly," "drew" have weight.

### Punctuation swap:
**Semicolon → Period:** "The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed. Romero killed directly below us."
**Effect:** Harder stop. Original's "and" creates continuity—bull positioned, therefore Romero kills. Period would break the causality, making them discrete facts. The "and" is crucial—it's coordination without subordination, but it implies sequence/causality subtly.

**Periods → Dashes:** "He profiled directly in front of the bull—drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta—and sighted along the blade."
**Effect:** Dashes create interruption, emphasis. Original's commas make actions flow—ritual sequence. Dashes would break the flow, calling attention to each action separately. Hemingway wants accumulation, not disruption.

### Focalization nudge:
**Current:** External focalization with momentary internal access ("as he wanted to")
**Shift to full external:** "He killed not as he had killed the last bull, but differently. He profiled directly in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade."
**Effect:** Removes the one moment of internal access—"as he wanted to" (volition). Without it, we lose the ethical dimension. The "wanted" is crucial—it distinguishes autonomous from compelled action, the code from mere competence.

### Tense shift:
**Past → Present:** "The bull is squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero kills directly below us..."
**Effect:** Historical present creates immediacy. But Hemingway's past tense is essential—this is retrospective narration, Jake Barnes telling us what happened. Present tense would make it feel like sports commentary, live-blogging. The pastness allows reflection, even if not stated.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

### Imitatio (new content, same scaffolding):
*The fish was hooked on all four barbs to be landed, and Santiago pulled directly above the gunwale. He pulled not as he had been forced to by the last marlin, but as he wanted to. He leaned directly over the side, gripped the line with both hands, and sighted along the taut wire.*

**Replicates:** Passive opening (animal positioned), active second clause (protagonist acts), spatial marker with "us" removed, antithesis (not forced/but wanted), three-verb sequence in final sentence, prepositional phrases providing spatial precision, technical vocabulary ("gunwale," "taut").

### Counter-Imitatio (same content, opposing scaffolding):
*The bull, magnificent and doomed, stood perfectly positioned on all four feet, awaiting the ritual death that would complete the ballet of blood and sand. Romero, standing directly below where we sat breathless in the stands, approached the moment of truth. Unlike his encounter with the previous bull—which had been chaotic and undignified, forcing him to improvise frantically—this time he could perform the kill with the classical purity he'd always envisioned. With ceremonial slowness, he turned his body into profile, presenting himself directly to the bull's line of sight, then reached into the scarlet folds of the muleta and withdrew the sword, lifting it until his eye aligned perfectly along the blade's deadly length.*

**Opposes:** Adjectives everywhere ("magnificent," "doomed," "breathless," "chaotic," "undignified," "classical," "ceremonial," "scarlet," "deadly"), metaphors ("ballet of blood and sand," "moment of truth"), psychological vocabulary ("envisioned"), subordinate clauses explaining causality, gerunds creating progressive aspect ("standing," "forcing"), explicit evaluation. Loses ALL Hemingway compression, restraint, parataxis. This is everything Hemingway rejects—over-writing, sentimentality, explanation.

### Compression (≤15 words):
*The bull stood squared. Romero killed directly below, as he wanted. He profiled, drew sword, sighted.*

**Keeps:** Core actions, "squared," "directly," "as he wanted," three-verb sequence. Cuts: "on all four feet," "to be killed," "the last bull" (contrast), "in front of bull," prepositional phrases detailing source/direction. At 15 words, barely comprehensible. Hemingway's version is already compressed—further reduction destroys coherence.

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. **Use parataxis to force reader inference—coordinate without subordinating.** (No "because"—just fact, fact, fact)
2. **Repeat key action verbs without euphemism or variation.** ("killed...killed...He killed"—unflinching directness)
3. **Deploy antithesis to encode ethics without stating values.** ("not forced...but wanted"—grammar teaches morality)
4. **Embed technical vocabulary without translation to establish authority.** ("muleta"—trust context, respect readers)
5. **Use spatial prepositions obsessively for concrete specificity.** ("on," "below," "in front," "out of," "along"—make reader see)
6. **Let passive voice create fatalism when thematically appropriate.** ("was squared...to be killed"—syntax enacts destiny)
7. **Omit inferable objects and verbs—trust active readership.** ("He killed" [the bull], "as he wanted to" [kill]—compression as engagement)
