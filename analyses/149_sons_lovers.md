## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Heart going "molten"
*Effect:* Makes emotion into physical transformation, volcanic.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "could not be too good for him"
*Effect:* Expresses absolute devotion through negative construction.

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions.
*Example:* "He was there, asleep on the bare floor."
*Effect:* Creates stark, declarative observations.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Stative Posture
"She sat still"—**stative verb** with manner adverb. Syntax shows immobility as active state.

### Participial Sensation
"feeling her heart go molten"—**present participle** with bare infinitive complement. Syntax makes sensation ongoing, processual.

### Modal Inability
"could not get up and look at him"—**modal negative** with coordinated infinitives. Syntax shows emotional paralysis.

### Deictic Location
"He was there"—**existential with spatial deixis**. Syntax marks presence as significant fact.

### Participial State
"asleep on the bare floor"—**participial phrase** with location. Syntax emphasizes humility of sleeping position.

### Prepositional Bareness
"on the bare floor"—**adjective emphasizing absence**. Syntax stresses lack of comfort.

### Modal Hyperbole
"could not be too good for him"—**double negative modal**. Syntax performs maternal absolutism through grammatical negation.

### Stylistic Effect
Through stative sitting, participial molten feeling, modal inability to move, deictic presence, bare floor positioning, and double negative devotion, Lawrence creates syntax of maternal paralysis—grammar showing how overwhelming emotion produces physical and perceptual immobility, culminating in the illogical grammar of absolute love.
