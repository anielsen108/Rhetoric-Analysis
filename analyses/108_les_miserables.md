# Passage 108: "The Bishop"

## Author and Source
**Victor Hugo**, *Les Misérables* (1862, translated from French)

## Passage
> So long as there shall exist, by reason of law and custom, a social condemnation, which, in the face of civilization, artificially creates hells on earth, and complicates a destiny that is divine with human fatality; so long as the three problems of the age—the degradation of man by poverty, the ruin of woman by starvation, and the dwarfing of childhood by physical and spiritual night—are not solved...books like this cannot be useless.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "So long as...so long as"
*Effect:* Creates prophetic insistence; accumulates social evils.

### **Tricolon** (try-KOH-lon)
*Definition:* Three parallel elements.
*Example:* "degradation of man...ruin of woman...dwarfing of childhood"
*Effect:* Catalogs social injustice systematically.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Social conditions as "hells on earth"; ignorance as "night"
*Effect:* Makes abstract injustice vividly infernal.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "cannot be useless"
*Effect:* Asserts book's necessity through double negative.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Extended Conditional
"So long as there shall exist"—**temporal-conditional subordinate clause** extending across multiple lines. Syntax creates suspense before resolution.

### Future Perfect
"shall exist"—**modal future**. Syntax prophesies persistence of injustice.

### Prepositional Cause
"by reason of law and custom"—**prepositional phrase** of cause. Syntax makes injustice systemic, not natural.

### Relative Clause Specification
"which...artificially creates"—**relative clause** with adverb emphasizing human creation. Syntax insists injustice is manufactured.

### Appositional Catalog
"the three problems of the age"—**appositive series** defining problems. Syntax enumerates evils systematically.

### Parallel Genitives
"degradation of man...ruin of woman...dwarfing of childhood"—**three parallel noun phrases** with genitive constructions. Syntax creates rhetorical balance while showing universal scope.

### Passive Negation
"are not solved"—**passive with negation**. Syntax emphasizes incompletion.

### Final Litotes
"cannot be useless"—**double negative**. Syntax understates necessity through negation.

### Stylistic Effect
Through extended conditional syntax, anaphoric insistence, tricolon catalog, and concluding litotes, Hugo creates grammar of prophetic social witness—syntax that demands justice while justifying literature's intervention.
