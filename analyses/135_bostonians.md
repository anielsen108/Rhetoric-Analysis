# Passage 135: "The Bostonians"

## Author and Source
**Henry James**, *The Bostonians* (1886)

## Passage
> Olive Chancellor was unmarried by every implication of her being. She was a spinster as Shelley was a lyric poet, or as the month of August is sultry.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* "as Shelley was a lyric poet, or as the month of August is sultry"
*Effect:* Makes spinsterhood essential, not contingent quality.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "as...or as" repeated.
*Effect:* Accumulates comparisons establishing essence.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Apparent contradiction.
*Example:* Unmarried "by every implication of her being" - suggests marriage impossible, not merely absent.
*Effect:* Makes singleness ontological, not circumstantial.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Passive Construction
"Olive Chancellor was unmarried"—**passive participle** as predicate adjective. Syntax emphasizes state over action or choice.

### Prepositional Cause
"by every implication of her being"—**prepositional phrase** of means/cause. Syntax makes unmarried status emanate from essence.

### Universal Quantifier
"every implication"—**universal determiner**. Syntax makes totality absolute.

### Genitive Essence
"of her being"—**genitive of abstract noun**. Syntax locates cause in existence itself.

### Copulative Identity
"She was a spinster"—**simple copula**. Syntax equates person with category.

### Parallel Similes
"as Shelley was...or as the month of August is"—**two comparative clauses** with copulas. Syntax creates parallel essential identities.

### Mixed Registers
Shelley (cultural/poetic) and August (natural/seasonal). Syntax links cultural and natural essences.

### Timeless Present
"is sultry"—**simple present** for August. Syntax makes comparison eternal, not particular.

### Stylistic Effect
Through passive unmarried state, prepositional essence, universal quantifier, copulative identity, and parallel similes linking cultural and natural essences, James creates syntax of ontological categorization—grammar that makes Olive's spinsterhood as inevitable and essential as Shelley's lyricism or August's heat.
