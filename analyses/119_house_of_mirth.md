## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Apparent contradiction.
*Example:* Victim of civilization that "produced" her.
*Effect:* Shows how society both creates and destroys its women.

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* "bracelet...like manacles"
*Effect:* Transforms luxury into imprisonment.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Ornament as chains; wealth as bondage.
*Effect:* Makes material privilege into captivity.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Passive Construction
"the civilization which had produced her"—**passive perfect** with relative clause. Syntax emphasizes Lily as product, not agent.

### Adverbial Emphasis
"so evidently"—**intensifying adverb**. Syntax makes victimhood obvious, undeniable.

### Relative Clause Specification
"which had produced her"—**past perfect relative clause**. Syntax shows civilization's prior creation of the victim it now destroys.

### Result Clause
"that the links...seemed like manacles"—**result clause** following "so evidently." Syntax makes jewelry's imprisonment logical consequence of visible victimhood.

### Participial Bondage
"chaining her to her fate"—**present participle** with prepositional object. Syntax performs the binding through continuing action.

### Possessive Fate
"her fate"—**possessive construction**. Syntax makes destiny both personal and inescapable.

### Stylistic Effect
Through passive production, evidential adverb, resultative syntax, and participial chaining, Wharton creates grammar of determinism—syntax that shows how Gilded Age women are manufactured by civilization then imprisoned by its ornaments, their jewels becoming manacles in a system that offers no escape.
