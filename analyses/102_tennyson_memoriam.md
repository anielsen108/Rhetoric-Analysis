## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "loved and lost" vs. "never to have loved"
*Effect:* Creates philosophical choice between experience and protection.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "I hold...I feel..."
*Effect:* Emphasizes personal conviction through repeated first person.

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus)
*Definition:* Inverted parallel structure.
*Example:* "loved and lost" / "never...loved" (love frames both clauses)
*Effect:* Makes love the constant despite loss.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Emphatic First Person
"I hold it true"—**subject-verb-object-complement**. Syntax asserts personal belief against doubt.

### Subordinate Concession
"whate'er befall"—**elliptical subordinate clause** (whatever may befall). Syntax admits uncertainty while maintaining conviction.

### Temporal Intensifier
"when I sorrow most"—**temporal clause** with superlative. Syntax locates truth in extremity of grief.

### Comparative Infinitive Structure
"'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved"—**comparative construction** with **paired infinitives**. Syntax creates philosophical balance.

### Perfect Infinitive
"to have loved and lost"—**perfect infinitive** emphasizes completed action. Syntax makes past experience the subject of present judgment.

### Negative Infinitive
"never to have loved at all"—**negated infinitive** with emphatic "at all." Syntax makes absence total, absolute.

### Stylistic Effect
Through anaphoric assertion, comparative infinitives, and antithetical structure, Tennyson creates syntax of hard-won wisdom—grammar that transforms grief into philosophical consolation.
