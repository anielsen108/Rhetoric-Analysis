# Passage 167: "The Bell Jar"

## Author and Source
**Sylvia Plath**, *The Bell Jar* (1963)

## Passage
> I felt very still and empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Simile** (SIM-uh-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* "the way the eye of a tornado must feel"
*Effect:* Makes depression into meteorological phenomenon.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Tornado eye "feeling"
*Effect:* Makes natural phenomenon sentient.

### **Oxymoron** (ahk-see-MOR-ahn)
*Definition:* Contradictory terms.
*Example:* "still" center of violent tornado
*Effect:* Captures paradox of depressive calm amid chaos.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Copulative Emotion
"I felt very still and empty"—**verb of sensation** with coordinated adjectives. Syntax makes absence into positive quality.

### Intensifier
"very"—**degree adverb**. Syntax emphasizes extremity of stillness.

### Comparative Structure
"the way"—**manner comparison**. Syntax introduces elaborate simile.

### Genitive Location
"the eye of a tornado"—**possessive with meteorological term**. Syntax identifies specific part of storm.

### Modal Speculation
"must feel"—**epistemic modal** with verb of sensation. Syntax projects feeling onto inanimate.

### Participial Movement
"moving dully along"—**present participle** with manner adverb. Syntax shows ongoing motion without volition.

### Prepositional Location
"in the middle of"—**spatial preposition** emphasizing center. Syntax positions speaker geometrically.

### Participial Surround
"the surrounding hullabaloo"—**present participle** as adjective with colloquial noun. Syntax makes chaos peripheral, encircling.

### Stylistic Effect
Through copulative still-empty sensation, comparative tornado-eye simile, modal must-feel projection, participial dully-moving, spatial middle-positioning, and surrounding hullabaloo, Plath creates syntax of depressive dissociation—grammar that makes mental illness into meteorological calm, speaker paradoxically still while moving through encircling chaos.
