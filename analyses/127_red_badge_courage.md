## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to non-human.
*Example:* Cold "passed reluctantly"; fogs "retiring"; army "awakened" and "tremble"
*Effect:* Makes nature and army into sentient beings with emotions.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Army as sleeping organism that awakens.
*Effect:* Transforms military unit into single living entity.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-EK-duh-kee)
*Definition:* Part for whole.
*Example:* "army" for individual soldiers.
*Effect:* Emphasizes collective over individual experience.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Adverbial Personification
"passed reluctantly"—**adverb of manner** giving human quality to cold. Syntax makes weather resistant, unwilling.

### Participial Revelation
"the retiring fogs revealed"—**present participle** as adjective with personifying verb. Syntax shows fogs as active agents withdrawing.

### Passive Participle Description
"stretched out on the hills, resting"—**two participles** modifying army. Syntax creates visual tableau.

### Temporal Subordinate Clause
"As the landscape changed"—**temporal clause** marks transition. Syntax links seasonal change to military awakening.

### Color Transformation
"from brown to green"—**prepositional phrase** of transformation. Syntax marks seasonal rebirth.

### Copulative Awakening
"the army awakened"—**simple subject-verb**. Syntax treats collective as singular organism.

### Infinitive Purpose
"began to tremble"—**infinitive** showing action. Syntax gives army human nervousness.

### Prepositional Cause
"at the noise of rumors"—**prepositional phrase** of cause. Syntax shows gossip as stimulus for collective anxiety.

### Stylistic Effect
Through personifying adverbs, participial revelation, collective singular subject, and infinitive trembling, Crane creates syntax of impressionistic naturalism—grammar that dissolves individual soldiers into atmospheric collective organism responding to environment.
