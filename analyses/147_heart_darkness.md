# Passage 147: "Heart of Darkness"

## Author and Source
**Joseph Conrad**, *Heart of Darkness* (1899/1902)

## Passage
> The reaches opened before us and closed behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Forest "stepped leisurely" to "bar the way"
*Effect:* Makes jungle into deliberate antagonist.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "opened before us and closed behind"
*Effect:* Creates symmetrical trap, spatial enclosure.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Journey as progressive entrapment.
*Effect:* Makes exploration into imprisonment.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Parallel Antithesis
"opened before us and closed behind"—**two parallel verbs** with opposed spatial adverbs. Syntax creates simultaneous trap.

### Deictic Markers
"before us...behind"—**spatial deixis** from travelers' perspective. Syntax anchors description to moving viewpoint.

### Subordinate Comparison
"as if the forest had stepped"—**comparative clause** with past perfect. Syntax presents personification as hypothesis.

### Adverbial Manner
"leisurely"—**manner adverb** modifying action. Syntax makes entrapment unhurried, deliberate.

### Prepositional Journey
"across the water"—**spatial preposition** showing movement. Syntax gives forest human locomotion.

### Infinitive Purpose
"to bar the way"—**purpose infinitive**. Syntax assigns intent to forest's action.

### Genitive Possession
"for our return"—**possessive with abstract noun**. Syntax makes return something they own but cannot access.

### Stylistic Effect
Through parallel antithetical opening/closing, personified forest stepping leisurely across water with purpose infinitive to bar return, Conrad creates syntax of colonial entrapment—grammar that performs the journey as progressive enclosure where nature itself conspires against escape.
