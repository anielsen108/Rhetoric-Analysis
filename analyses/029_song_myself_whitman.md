# Passage 029: "Song of Myself" Opening

## Author and Source
**Walt Whitman**, *Leaves of Grass* (1855), "Song of Myself," Section 1

## Passage
> I celebrate myself, and sing myself,
> And what I assume you shall assume,
> For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "I celebrate myself, and sing myself" / "And what I assume"
*Effect:* Creates incantatory rhythm; emphasizes the self while building toward connection with reader.

### **Parallelism** (par-uh-LEL-iz-um)
*Definition:* Similar grammatical structures.
*Example:* "celebrate myself...sing myself" / "belonging to me...belongs to you"
*Effect:* Creates balance between self-assertion and universal connection.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Seemingly contradictory statement containing truth.
*Example:* Extreme individualism ("I celebrate myself") leading to universal connection ("belongs to you").
*Effect:* Resolves American tension between individual and community.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-EK-duh-kee)
*Definition:* Part representing whole.
*Example:* "every atom" representing the entire self/body/soul.
*Effect:* Makes connection elemental, scientific, physical, undeniable.

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus)
*Definition:* Reversal of grammatical structure.
*Example:* "belonging to me" (participle phrase) / "belongs to you" (verb phrase)—similar ideas in reversed syntax.
*Effect:* Creates elegant balance; suggests reciprocity between self and other.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Double Verb Construction
"I celebrate myself, and sing myself"—the syntax uses **two parallel verbs** sharing the same subject and object:
- I celebrate myself
- [I] sing myself

The **reflexive "myself"** appears twice, emphasizing the self while also creating rhythmic repetition. The comma + "and" creates both pause and continuation.

### Coordinate Independent Clause
"And what I assume you shall assume"—this line begins with **coordinating conjunction "And"** starting an independent clause, which is unconventional. The syntax creates cumulative, additive effect.

The **parallel structure** "I assume...you shall assume" creates what Tufte calls syntactic reciprocity. The **modal auxiliary "shall"** (not "will") creates both future tense and sense of obligation/inevitability.

### Scientific Diction
"For every atom belonging to me"—the **prepositional phrase** uses "atom" (scientific term) for what romantic poets might call "soul" or "essence." The syntax modernizes spiritual connection through scientific language.

The **present participle "belonging"** creates active relationship—not "every atom of me" (static possession) but "belonging to me" (dynamic relationship).

### Comparative Structure
"as good belongs to you"—the **comparative phrase "as good"** (meaning "equally well" or "just as much") creates equivalence. The syntax through comparison asserts democratic equality at the atomic level.

### Stylistic Effect
Through parallel verbs, reciprocal pronouns, and scientific diction within poetic form, Whitman creates his revolutionary democratic syntax. The form enacts the content: self-celebration leads to universal connection; what belongs to me belongs to you. This is syntax as American philosophy—individualism and democracy unified through grammar.
