# Passage 029: "Song of Myself" Opening

**Walt Whitman** · *Leaves of Grass* · 1855 | "Song of Myself," Section 1 (lines 1-3)

**Occasion/Pressure:** Opening salvo of a radically democratic poem must invite the reader into shared identity without losing Whitman's ecstatic selfhood.
**Persona/Stance:** First-person bard, conversational yet oracular; intimacy fused with prophetic swagger.
**Thesis of Effect:** Syntax stages a paradoxical merge—self-celebration as communal embrace—by letting repetition and reciprocity turn ego into chorus.

## PASSAGE

[L1] I celebrate myself, and sing myself,
[L2] And what I assume you shall assume,
[L3] For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh / əˈnæfərə)
**Lines:** L1–2
**Definition:** Repetition at successive clause openings.
**Evidence:** "I" launches both finite verbs in L1; "And" doubles as additive hinge at L2.
**Effect:** Incantatory drumbeat binds self-proclamation to reader inclusion. Repetition frames democracy as rhythm.
**Near-miss:** Not epistrophe (end repetition); this is front-loaded cadence.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks / ˈpærədɒks)
**Lines:** L1–3
**Definition:** Apparently contradictory truths fused for higher insight.
**Evidence:** Self-celebration culminates in shared ownership of atoms.
**Effect:** Individualism equals universalism. Reader feels shock of ego that dissolves into community.
**Near-miss:** Not oxymoron; spans entire sentence logic, not adjacent contradictory terms.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-EK-duh-kee / sɪˈnɛkdəki)
**Lines:** L3
**Definition:** Part standing for whole.
**Evidence:** "every atom" stands in for total personhood.
**Effect:** Reduces identity to elemental particles, making communion literal and scientific.
**Risk:** Without context, could feel reductive; Whitman uses accumulation elsewhere to re-inflate.

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus / kaɪˈæzməs)
**Lines:** L3
**Definition:** Reversal of grammatical structures.
**Evidence:** "belonging to me" ↔ "belongs to you" flips possession roles.
**Effect:** Creates hinge of reciprocity; reader experiences syntactic mirror enacting equality.
**Near-miss:** Not antimetabole (no exact lexical reversal; structure, not words, invert).

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Parataxis → Hypotaxis Blend**
**Lines:** L1–3
**Definition:** Coordination juxtaposed with subordination.
**Evidence:** L1–2: loose coordination through "and". L3 introduces causal/perhaps justificatory "For".
**Effect:** Start feels like equal clauses breathing freely; rationale enters with "For," grounding ecstasy in logic.

### **Polysyndeton** (PAH-lee-SIN-duh-ton / ˌpɒlɪˈsɪndətɒn)
**Lines:** L1–3
**Definition:** Repetition of conjunctions.
**Evidence:** "and" twice in L1, again in L2's opening.
**Effect:** Adds rolling momentum, mimicking endless inclusion. Reader hears democratic accumulation.

### **Epanalepsis** (eh-pan-uh-LEP-sis / ˌɛpənəˈlɛpsɪs)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Clause begins and ends with same word or concept.
**Evidence:** "I celebrate myself, and sing myself" — "myself" frames the clause.
**Effect:** Encircles the speaker in grammar, enacting self-embrace.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Reflexive Intensification**
**Signals:** Twin reflexive objects ("myself") in L1.
**Effect on stance:** Speaker multiplies self-objectification—subject acts upon self, granting autonomy to both roles.
**Classical kin:** Reflexive pronoun of Latin/Greek emphasis; akin to Whitman's appropriation of grammatical middle voice.

### **Left-Edge Coordination**
**Signals:** Sentence opens with full clause then attaches additive clause without subordination.
**Effect:** Suggests thought-in-progress; voice feels improvised yet assured.
**Classical kin:** Homeric and Biblical additive storytelling.

### **End-Weight Justification**
**Signals:** Longest clause is final causal "For every atom…"
**Effect:** After two declarations, reason arrives, anchoring ethos. Reader perceives logic as gift, not prerequisite.
**Classical kin:** Periodic rationale following loose front matter; reminiscent of Cicero's delayed proof.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Liquids (l, m) and sibilants (s) dominate, creating soft swells. "celebrate" / "sing" share initial consonant clusters, forging musical kinship.

**Cadence seams:** Comma in L1 acts as mid-line caesura; the comma after "them" (implied) absent—Whitman trusts breath control.

**Alliterative webs:** "celebrate," "sing," "assume"—soft sibilants connect lines; "belonging" / "belongs" double b-l cluster, emphasising shared lexicon.

**Music argues:** Song-like soundscape sells rhetorical content: celebration literally sung through phonetics.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Loose-cumulative; base clause (L1) followed by additive coordinate, concluding with causal clause.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** None; Whitman eschews introduction to plunge into first-person.
- **Mid:** Reflexive pronouns and conjunctions modulate flow.
- **Postposed:** Causal "For" clause arrives as tail, reinterpreting entire sequence.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Two coordinates to one subordinate; emphasis on equality, not hierarchy.

**Information flow:** Self (given) → assumption (negotiation) → atoms (scientific rationale). Reader moves from interior to universal.

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"I celebrate myself and you with me; each atom we share."* — Loses Whitman's airy cadence and layered conjunctions.
- **Dilated:** *"I take up the glad hymn of my own being, and what notions I adopt you too shall, for every indivisible corpuscle accruing to me by right accrues equally to you."* — Gains mock-grandiloquence but forfeits organic simplicity.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Present-tense "I" invites reader into immediate now; "you" collapses distance.

**Aspect:** Simple present expresses habitual truth, not momentary act.

**Modality:** "shall" introduces inevitability/command hybrid—quasi-biblical vow that reader will share assumptions.

**Negation:** None explicit; instead, positive affirmation saturates.

**Temporal logic:** No chronology; eternal present underscores universal claim.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Musical:** "celebrate," "sing" frame poem as song.
2. **Scientific/atomic:** "every atom" positions democracy within physics.

**Lexical fields:** Selfhood vocabulary (I, myself) intersects with relational lexicon (you, every). Chemistry merges with intimacy.

**Image logic:** Song (cultural) + atoms (scientific) = holistic modern spirituality.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** First-person direct address; zero distance. Reader stands inside speaker's breath.

**Time:** Eternal gnomic statement; no narrative event.

**Beat structure:** Declaration → invitation → justification. Each line escalates from self to universal.

**Subtext:** Egalitarianism disguised as ego: by overstating "I," Whitman smuggles in "we."

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Confidence in self-knowledge; willingness to claim universal connection builds trust through boldness.

**Pathos:** Shared atoms evoke intimacy; reader feels warmth of inclusion.

**Logos:** Causal "For" provides rational basis: scientific equality ensures shared destiny.

**Strategy:** Startle with ego, disarm with inclusion, secure with reason.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Biblical cadence:** Echoes Genesis-style declaratives; Whitman repurposes scripture for democracy.

**Romantic self:** Builds on Emersonian self-reliance but extends it toward communal fusion.

**Scientific modernity:** Integrates 19th-c. atomic theory, bridging poetry with emerging science.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"I celebrate myself"** — Thesis and provocation in four syllables.
2. **"And what I assume you shall assume"** — Invitation that is also command.
3. **"every atom"** — Micro-scale metaphor grounding macro-politics.

### Faultlines
1. **Potential narcissism** — Without L3, the passage risks solipsism. **Revision test:** Add "so do you" after "sing myself" to telegraph inclusion earlier.
2. **Ambiguous "assume"** — Could read as presumption. **Revision test:** Swap for "embrace"; would soften but also dilute intellectual rigor.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove "For" clause. Result: self-love with no communal rationale. Whitman's democratic thrust disappears.

**Amplification test:** Extend polysyndeton—"and breathe myself" etc.—would heighten chant but risk monotony.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** "I extol my person, and likewise intone it; that which I postulate you shall likewise postulate." — Gains legalese, loses warmth.
- **Colloquial:** "I'm hyped on me, singing my own tune, and whatever I vibe, you will too 'cause every piece of me is yours." — Gains immediacy, sacrifices mythic tone.

**Punctuation swap:** Replace commas with semicolons. Outcome: stiff, hierarchical segmentation. Original commas keep flow communal.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *I exhale myself, and echo myself; and whatever breath I draw you draw, for each molecule that clings to me cleaves just as well to you.* — Mirrors reflexives, conjunctions, atom imagery.

**Counter-Imitatio:** *My name is Walt. I have beliefs; if you agree, fine. We share humanity.* — Declarative, no chant, no atomic metaphor; shows how flat prose becomes without Whitman's syntactic charisma.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *I celebrate and sing myself, and whatever I take on you will too, because every atom in me belongs equally to you.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Start with unapologetic self-naming to seize authority.
2. Use reflexive pronouns to dramatize self-awareness.
3. Stack conjunctions to mimic inclusivity and accumulation.
4. Follow bold declarations with causal grounding to earn trust.
5. Fuse scientific diction with spiritual rhetoric for modern transcendence.
6. Let syntax perform reciprocity (chiasmus) to embody equality.
7. Address reader directly to collapse distance.
