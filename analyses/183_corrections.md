# Passage 183: "The Corrections"

## Author and Source
**Jonathan Franzen**, *The Corrections* (2001)

## Passage
> The madness of an autumn prairie cold front coming through. You could feel it: something terrible was going to happen. The sun low in the sky, a minor light, a cooling star. Gust after gust of disorder.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Weather as "madness"; gusts as "disorder"
*Effect:* Makes meteorological into psychological threat.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Sun as "cooling star"
*Effect:* Makes familiar sun cosmic and dying.

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh)
*Definition:* Verb governing different objects.
*Example:* "feel" governing both atmospheric and psychological threat.
*Effect:* Links physical sensation to emotional premonition.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Nominal Opening
"The madness of an autumn prairie cold front"—**definite noun phrase** with multiple genitives. Syntax makes weather into insanity.

### Participial Coming
"coming through"—**present participle** with phrasal verb. Syntax shows weather arriving.

### Modal Sensation
"You could feel it"—**modal auxiliary** with generic pronoun. Syntax makes perception universal possibility.

### Colon Explanation
"You could feel it: something terrible was going to happen"—**colon introducing interpretation**. Syntax explains feeling's meaning.

### Indefinite Terrible
"something terrible"—**indefinite pronoun** with adjective. Syntax refuses to specify threat.

### Future Progressive
"was going to happen"—**periphrastic future**. Syntax shows inevitability.

### Nominal Sun
"The sun low in the sky"—**absolute phrase** without verb. Syntax creates fragmentary observation.

### Appositive Diminishment
"a minor light, a cooling star"—**two appositive phrases**. Syntax redefines sun as weak, dying.

### Nominal Gusts
"Gust after gust of disorder"—**repetitive noun phrase** with abstract genitive. Syntax makes wind into chaos.

### Stylistic Effect
Through nominal madness-of-cold-front opening, modal you-could-feel universalizing, colon-explained something-terrible premonition, absolute sun-low-in-sky fragment, appositive minor-light/cooling-star diminishment, and repetitive gust-after-gust-of-disorder, Franzen creates syntax of meteorological dread—grammar that fragments observations and makes weather into inevitable psychological and cosmic threat through nominal accumulation.
