# Passage 121: "Community, Identity, Stability"

## Author and Source
**Aldous Huxley**, *Brave New World* (1932)

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to apparent.
*Example:* Motto of world that destroys community, identity, and stability.
*Effect:* Exposes dystopian inversion of values.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* "words mocked"
*Effect:* Makes language itself complicit in satire.

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh)
*Definition:* One verb governing different objects.
*Example:* "mocked the gigantic letters in which they were written" - words mock their own physical form.
*Effect:* Creates semantic complexity; form contradicts content.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Tricolon Opening
"Community, Identity, Stability"—**three abstract nouns** without verbs. Syntax creates slogan through asyndetic listing.

### Personified Subject
"The words mocked"—**abstract subject** with human verb. Syntax gives language agency to satirize itself.

### Relative Clause
"in which they were written"—**passive relative clause**. Syntax describes physical manifestation.

### Adjectival Intensifier
"gigantic letters"—**size adjective** emphasizes state propaganda scale. Syntax makes ideology physically overwhelming.

### Bureaucratic Initialism
"The D.H.C."—**abbreviated title**. Syntax dehumanizes through acronym.

### Habitual Past
"always made a point"—**adverb with past tense** expressing habit. Syntax shows ritual nature of indoctrination.

### Gerund Object
"personally conducting his new students"—**gerund phrase** as object. Syntax makes personal attention seem methodical, not warm.

### Stylistic Effect
Through tricolon slogan, personified mocking words, bureaucratic abbreviation, and gerund expressing habitual indoctrination ritual, Huxley creates syntax of totalitarian efficiency—grammar that performs dystopia through the gap between slogans and satiric reality.
