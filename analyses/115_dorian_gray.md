# Passage 115: "The Preface"

## Author and Source
**Oscar Wilde**, *The Picture of Dorian Gray* (1890)

## Passage
> There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "moral or...immoral" vs. "well written, or badly written"
*Effect:* Replaces ethical with aesthetic judgment.

### **Epistrophe** (ee-PIS-truh-fee)
*Definition:* Repetition at end.
*Example:* "written...written" at clause ends.
*Effect:* Emphasizes craft over content.

### **Aphorism** (AF-or-iz-um)
*Definition:* Concise statement of principle.
*Example:* Entire passage functions as provocative maxim.
*Effect:* Creates memorable, quotable aesthetic manifesto.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Negative Existential
"There is no such thing as"—**existential negative** with demonstrative. Syntax categorically denies possibility.

### Disjunctive Categories
"a moral or an immoral book"—**two noun phrases** connected by disjunction. Syntax presents false binary to reject.

### Passive Construction
"are...written"—**passive voice** emphasizes process over agent. Syntax makes writing the measure of value.

### Adverbial Opposition
"well...or badly"—**two manner adverbs** in opposition. Syntax reduces judgment to binary craft assessment.

### Demonstrative Finality
"That is all"—**demonstrative pronoun** with copula and totalizing "all." Syntax closes off further discussion.

### Sentence Fragments as Style
Three short declarative sentences. Syntax creates aphoristic, epigrammatic effect through brevity.

### Stylistic Effect
Through categorical negative existential, ethical/aesthetic opposition, passive voice emphasizing craft, and final demonstrative closure, Wilde creates syntax of aesthetic manifesto—grammar that dismisses moral criticism through curt, epigrammatic assertion of art's autonomy.
