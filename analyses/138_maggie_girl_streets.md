## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Bathos** (BAY-thahs)
*Definition:* Descent from elevated to trivial.
*Example:* "for the honor of Rum Alley"
*Effect:* Applies chivalric language to slum street fight.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to places.
*Example:* "Rum Alley" and "Devil's Row" as entities with honor.
*Effect:* Makes slum geography into warring kingdoms.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-EK-duh-kee)
*Definition:* Part for whole.
*Example:* Boy represents entire neighborhood.
*Effect:* Makes child into champion of territory.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Intensifying Adjective
"A very little boy"—**adverb intensifying adjective**. Syntax emphasizes smallness against grandiosity of cause.

### Passive Position
"stood upon a heap of gravel"—**intransitive verb** with prepositional location. Syntax establishes precarious position.

### Prepositional Purpose
"for the honor of Rum Alley"—**purpose phrase** with abstract noun. Syntax ironically applies chivalric motivation to street brawl.

### Progressive Action
"was throwing stones"—**past progressive**. Syntax shows ongoing, continuous battle.

### Participial Description
"howling urchins"—**present participle** as adjective. Syntax makes opponents animalistic.

### Genitive Origin
"from Devil's Row"—**prepositional phrase** with possessive. Syntax establishes geographic/tribal allegiance.

### Relative Clause Actions
"who were circling...and pelting"—**two progressive verbs** in relative clause. Syntax shows simultaneous coordinated attack.

### Adverbial Intensity
"circling madly"—**manner adverb** emphasizes chaotic movement. Syntax performs frenzied violence.

### Stylistic Effect
Through intensifying smallness, chivalric purpose phrase applied to slum honor, progressive verbs showing ongoing battle, participial animalization, and adverbial madness, Crane creates syntax of mock-heroic naturalism—grammar that simultaneously elevates and exposes the desperate violence of poverty.
