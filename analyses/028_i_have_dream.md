## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at the beginning of successive clauses.
*Example:* "I have a dream" repeated throughout the speech (this is the first instance).
*Effect:* Creates rhythmic emphasis; builds momentum; makes the vision personal and prophetic.

### **Allusion** (uh-LOO-zhun)
*Definition:* Reference to another text or historical document.
*Example:* Direct quotation from the Declaration of Independence.
*Effect:* Links civil rights movement to founding American principles; claims moral authority.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Nation as living being that can "rise up" and "live out" principles.
*Effect:* Makes abstract political entity concrete and active; suggests awakening or resurrection.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nif-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Attribution of human qualities to non-human things.
*Example:* The nation "will rise up and live out" its creed.
*Effect:* Makes national destiny a matter of moral choice and action.

### **Epistrophe** (eh-PIS-truh-fee)
*Definition:* Repetition at the end of successive clauses (in broader speech context).
*Example:* Throughout the speech, clauses end with visions of equality.
*Effect:* Creates closure and emphasis on key concepts.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### First Person Declaration
"I have a dream"—the syntax begins with **first person singular subject + verb + object**. This is remarkably personal for a speech addressing hundreds of thousands. The syntax makes the vision individual before making it collective.

The **present perfect tense** ("have") rather than simple present ("I dream") suggests the dream is ongoing, not momentary—it exists, persists, continues.

### Subordinate Noun Clause
"that one day this nation will rise up"—the **noun clause** introduced by "that" serves as appositive to "dream," specifying its content. The syntax creates a layered structure: I have a dream [which is] that...

The **temporal phrase "one day"** is deliberately vague—not specifying when creates both hope (it will happen) and patience (we don't know when).

### Future Tense
"will rise up and live out"—the **future tense** expresses certainty, not mere hope. The syntax through modal choice asserts the inevitability of justice.

The **two verbs** "rise up" and "live out" create parallel actions:
- "rise up" (awakening, resurrection, elevation)
- "live out" (embodiment, practice, fulfillment)

### Colon and Quotation
The **colon** introduces the embedded quotation from Jefferson. This syntax creates formal citation, lending authority to the vision. King's syntax literally builds on Jefferson's, creating structural unity between 1776 and 1963.

### Stylistic Effect
Through personal declaration, future certainty, and embedded quotation from the Declaration, King creates syntax that is simultaneously intimate (I have a dream) and universal (quoting founding document). The form enacts the content: individual vision grounded in collective American principles. As Tufte would note, the syntax performs the rhetorical work of making revolution sound like patriotism, making radical change sound like fulfillment of original promise.
