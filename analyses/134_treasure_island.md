# Passage 134: "Treasure Island"

## Author and Source
**Robert Louis Stevenson**, *Treasure Island* (1883)

## Passage
> Fifteen men on the dead man's chest—Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! Drink and the devil had done for the rest—Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Refrain** (rih-FRAYN)
*Definition:* Repeated phrase.
*Example:* "Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"
*Effect:* Creates chanty rhythm; makes song memorable and ominous.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "done for" means killed.
*Effect:* Creates casual, callous tone toward death.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Associated term substituting.
*Example:* "Drink and the devil" for drunken violence.
*Effect:* Personifies causes of pirate deaths.

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions.
*Example:* "Drink and the devil" (only one conjunction for two agents).
*Effect:* Links alcohol and evil as unified force.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Numerical Opening
"Fifteen men"—**number with noun**. Syntax creates precise, ominous count.

### Prepositional Location
"on the dead man's chest"—**spatial preposition** with possessive. Syntax places living on dead; creates gruesome image.

### Interjection Refrain
"Yo-ho-ho"—**nautical interjection** without grammatical function. Syntax breaks into song, interrupting narrative.

### Coordinate Objects
"Drink and the devil"—**two subjects** coordinated. Syntax treats alcohol and Satan as equal agents.

### Past Perfect Completion
"had done for the rest"—**past perfect** with phrasal verb. Syntax marks completed destruction before present moment.

### Parallel Structure
Two clauses with identical refrain. Syntax creates ballad repetition.

### Stylistic Effect
Through numerical precision, spatial preposition placing living on dead, interjective refrain, coordinate subjects linking drink and devil, and past perfect completion, Stevenson creates syntax of pirate ballad—grammar that combines gruesome content with jaunty rhythm, making death casual through musical structure.
