## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Frame Narrative** (fraym NAIR-uh-tiv)
*Definition:* Story within a story.
*Example:* Speaker reports what traveller said.
*Effect:* Creates distance from the scene; suggests this is ancient, reported knowledge.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-EK-duh-kee)
*Definition:* Part representing whole.
*Example:* "legs" and "visage" representing the entire fallen statue/empire.
*Effect:* Emphasizes fragmentation; the mighty are reduced to scattered parts.

### **Oxymoron** (ok-see-MOR-on)
*Definition:* Combination of contradictory terms.
*Example:* "Half sunk" and "shattered visage" (a face that commanded but now lies broken).
*Effect:* Captures the contradiction of power that has fallen.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Deliberate exaggeration.
*Example:* "vast" legs, the enormity of the implied statue.
*Effect:* Emphasizes the scale of the tyrant's ambition and the scale of his fall.

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Expression opposite to literal meaning.
*Example:* The whole poem—the boastful king's works have perished.
*Effect:* Creates the poem's central theme: pride precedes fall, empires crumble.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Opening Past Tense
"I met a traveller from an antique land"—simple **subject-verb-object** with prepositional phrase. The **past tense** "met" creates a chance encounter, suggesting the story's accidental discovery. The modifier "antique" (not "ancient") creates slightly elevated, even precious diction.

### Frame Device
"Who said—"—the **dash** after "said" introduces direct quotation. The syntax creates a frame: we're about to hear someone else's words, distancing us twice from the scene (speaker heard from traveller who saw the statue).

### Descriptive Subject
"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone"—the **subject** of the traveller's account is body parts, not a person. The syntax makes fragmentation the grammatical subject. The adjective "trunkless" (without body/torso) emphasizes incompleteness through negation.

### Simple Present
"Stand in the desert"—the **present tense** within the past-tense frame creates immediacy. The legs still stand, present tense, eternal. The syntax through tense shift makes the ruins contemporary.

### Spatial Relationship
"Near them, on the sand"—stacked **prepositional phrases** create precise spatial positioning. The syntax places us in the scene geographically.

### Participial Construction
"Half sunk"—the **past participle** without auxiliary creates compressed syntax. Not "is half sunk" but just "half sunk," making it adjectival, describing the visage's state.

### Modifier Accumulation
"a shattered visage"—the **adjective** "shattered" before noun emphasizes destruction. Then "whose frown, / And wrinkled lip, and sneer" creates **tricolon** (three-part list) of facial features that survived, each conveying the tyrant's character.

### Stylistic Effect
Through frame narrative, present tense within past frame, and fragmented subjects, Shelley creates syntax that enacts the poem's theme. The broken syntax (fragments, dashes, ellipses) mirrors the broken statue. The form IS the decay it describes—syntax as ruin.
