# Passage 106: "To the Reader" ("Au Lecteur")

**Charles Baudelaire** · *Les Fleurs du mal* · 1857 | Opening quatrain (Richard Howard translation)

**Occasion/Pressure:** The prologue must indict the reader and expose shared depravity, blending sermon with confession.
**Persona/Stance:** Accuser-complicit narrator; sardonic preacher who includes himself in the damned choir.
**Thesis of Effect:** Syntax turns moral rot into ritual by pairing emphatic clefts, oxymoronic juxtapositions, and incremental descent so condemnation feels inevitable and intimate.

## PASSAGE

[L1] It is the Devil who holds the strings that move us!
[L2] In repugnant objects we find appealing charms;
[L3] Each day we descend one step further toward Hell,
[L4] Without horror, through stinking shadows.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun / ˌpɜːrsənɪfɪˈkeɪʃən)
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** Grants human/animate agency to abstractions.
**Evidence:** Devil becomes puppeteer manipulating strings.
**Effect:** Evil is not abstract temptation but active stagehand. Reader feels bodily controlled, not merely tempted.
**Near-miss:** Not metaphor of comparison only; agency implies real actor within symbolic frame.

### **Oxymoron** (ok-sih-MOR-on / ˌɒksɪˈmɔːrɒn)
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Adjacent contradiction.
**Evidence:** "repugnant" vs. "appealing" fused around "objects" / "charms."
**Effect:** Captures perverse attraction to the foul—moral taste inverted.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for / ˈmɛtəfɔːr)
**Lines:** L3
**Definition:** Implicit comparison.
**Evidence:** Daily living mapped as stair-descent toward Hell.
**Effect:** Condemns routine as downward pilgrimage; no neutral ground exists.

### **Litotes** (LYE-tuh-teez / ˈlaɪtoʊtiːz)
**Lines:** L4
**Definition:** Understatement via negation.
**Evidence:** "Without horror" says we feel *no* horror.
**Effect:** Ironically highlights numbness; absence of fear becomes ultimate indictment.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Cleft Sentence**
**Lines:** L1
**Definition:** "It is X who…" structure for emphasis.
**Evidence:** "It is the Devil who holds…"
**Effect:** Spotlight shifts from humanity to Devil; syntax frames moral drama as manipulation.

### **Inversion (Anastrophe)**
**Lines:** L2
**Definition:** Reversed word order.
**Evidence:** "In repugnant objects we find" front-loads prepositional phrase.
**Effect:** Reader experiences tilt; subject arrives late, mirroring perverted desire.

### **Anaphoric Temporal Ladder**
**Lines:** L3
**Definition:** Repetition of temporal marker to show sequence.
**Evidence:** "Each day" resets condemnation.
**Effect:** Accumulation of days equals descent; repetition anchors inevitability.

### **Parataxis to Hypotaxis Drift**
**Lines:** L1–L4
**Definition:** Movement from independent declarations to dependent modifiers.
**Effect:** L1-L3 deliver pronouncements; L4 attaches prepositional phrases, trapping reader in fetid detail.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Agency Displacement**
**Signals:** Subject of first clause is "It" with Devil as focus.
**Effect on stance:** Narrator offloads culpability to Satan while still implicating "us." Reader senses structural doom.
**Classical kin:** Medieval morality plays where Devil manipulates characters.

### **Habituated Aspect Encoding**
**Signals:** Simple present with "each day" implies iterative aspect.
**Effect:** Morality not singular fall but ritual habit. Syntax condemns daily routine.
**Classical kin:** Liturgical litanies marking daily offices; here turned satanic.

### **Prepositional Immersion**
**Signals:** L4's double prepositional phrases "Without… through…"
**Effect:** Surrounds reader in moral atmosphere; grammar acts as miasma.
**Classical kin:** Latin ablative absolutes expressing condition; Baudelaire adapts to French/English with prepositions.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Hard plosives (Devil, strings) crunch against sibilants (strings, us), imitating tugging cords.

**Cadence seams:** Semicolon at L2 enforces bitter pause; comma in L3 mimics step-by-step fall.

**Alliteration:** "stinking shadows" hisses with sibilant s + sh, layering smell and darkness.

**Music argues:** Sonic descent from exclamatory shout (L1) to guttural "stinking" ends; reader hears fall into sludge.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** One extended sentence broken into three clauses plus dangling prepositional tail.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** Inversion of "In repugnant objects" unsettles expectation.
- **Mid:** Relative "that move us" attaches to "strings," clarifying instrument of control.
- **Postposed:** "Without horror, through stinking shadows" trails, adding environmental rot after action.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Balanced—coordinate clauses in L1-L3, subordinate modifiers in L4.

**Information flow:** Cause (Devil) → symptom (perverse attraction) → trajectory (descent) → sensory condition (odor, darkness).

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"The Devil pulls our strings; we love foul things and step daily toward Hell without fear, through stench."* — Clarity gained, menace softened.
- **Dilated:** *"It is indeed the Devil who, fingers insinuated into the taut strings that jerk our limbs, conducts us; within the hideous we sniff a secret sweetness, and each passing day sinks us another stair toward Hell, absent even the ghost of horror, drifting through effluvial shadow."* — Gothic flourish heightens decadence but sacrifices brutal directness.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deictic center:** Speaker + reader fused as "us"; no spatial anchor beyond Hell as destination.

**Aspect:** Iterative simple present expresses endless repetition.

**Modality:** No modals; inevitability arises from declarative certainty.

**Negative polarity:** "Without horror" highlights absence, emphasising spiritual anesthesia.

**Temporal logic:** "Each day" frames descent as calendar ritual; condemnation is scheduled.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:**
1. **Puppetry:** Strings, movement, Devil as puppeteer.
2. **Sensory corruption:** Repugnant/appealing paradox, "stinking shadows."
3. **Spatial descent:** Steps toward Hell.

**Lexical fields:** Religious (Devil, Hell) intersects with theatrical (strings), olfactory/visual decay (stinking, shadows).

**Image logic:** Theatrical control + sensual perversion + descent = decadent theology.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Homodiegetic narrator implicates self and reader equally; zero distance.

**Time:** Present habitual; narrative tension comes from unstoppable downward progression.

**Beat structure:** Reveal controller → confess perverse attraction → mark daily descent → describe insensate environment.

**Subtext:** Shared guilt forms complicity contract: accusation equals invitation to continue reading because we're already damned.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Speaker knows depravity intimately; direct address "us" fosters credibility born of shared sin.

**Pathos:** Horror emerges via sensory imagery (stench, shadows) and moral nausea.

**Logos:** Logical chain—because Devil manipulates, we love filth; therefore we descend. Final clause proves numbness.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Augustinian confession:** Echoes *Confessions* self-accusation but without redemption.

**French moraliste tradition:** Pascal-like awareness of wretchedness.

**Symbolist seed:** Musical emphasis on sensation anticipates later decadent poets.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"It is the Devil"** — Opening cleft names antagonist unequivocally.
2. **"repugnant…appealing"** — Shock of contradiction.
3. **"Without horror"** — Damning revelation of insensibility.

### Faultlines
1. **Translation choices:** "Appealing" may feel mild. **Revision test:** swap to "bewitching" for sharper sting.
2. **Potential determinism:** Devil's total agency might absolve humans. **Fix:** Add "who gladly yields the strings." Would implicate us more overtly.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove "Without horror"—result: descent still occurs but loses critique of numbness; tone softens.

**Amplification test:** Extend sensory imagery: "through stinking shadows and viscous smoke"—heightens disgust but risks purple excess.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"It is the Devil who manipulates our animating cords; within abhorrent matter we discern enticing graces."* — More Latinate; cold sermon.
- **Colloquial:** *"The Devil's got our strings; we dig gross stuff, step by step toward Hell, not even freaked, wading through stink and gloom."* — Accessible but loses decadent musicality.

**Punctuation swap:** Change semicolon to period between L2-L3. Outcome: choppier rhythm, less inexorable fall.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *It is the Maggot who keeps his fingers knotted in our nerves; in sour rot we sniff out sweets; each dusk we slump another rung toward the pit, unalarmed, through perfumed decay.*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *We are tempted. Sometimes gross things seem nice. Every day we get worse and don't even mind.* — Bland, no ritual severity.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *The Devil jerks our strings; we adore vile charms and descend daily toward Hell, unafraid, through rancid shadow.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Use cleft sentences to hurl spotlight onto your chosen culprit.
2. Pair oxymoron with sensory detail to depict moral inversion vividly.
3. Signal habitual sin by coupling simple present with temporal adverbials.
4. Trail condemning clauses with prepositional muck to immerse the reader in decay.
5. Switch between grand metaphors (Hell) and bodily senses to keep spiritual stakes tangible.
6. Accuse yourself alongside the reader for unsettling complicity.
7. Let absence (“without horror”) condemn more sharply than direct blame.
