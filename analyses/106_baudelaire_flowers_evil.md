## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* Devil as puppeteer "holding strings"
*Effect:* Makes evil an active agent controlling humanity.

### **Oxymoron** (ok-see-MOR-on)
*Definition:* Contradictory terms together.
*Example:* "repugnant objects" with "appealing charms"
*Effect:* Captures perverse attraction to corruption.

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Humans as marionettes; life as descent to Hell.
*Effect:* Denies human agency; makes damnation incremental.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Emphatic Cleft
"It is the Devil who"—**cleft sentence** for emphasis. Syntax foregrounds the agent of human action.

### Relative Clause Agency
"who holds the strings that move us"—**nested relative clauses**. Syntax shows Devil controlling motions that control us.

### Prepositional Paradox
"In repugnant objects we find appealing charms"—**inverted syntax** with **prepositional phrase** fronted. Syntax creates surprise through word order.

### Temporal Iteration
"Each day"—**temporal adverbial** emphasizing repetition. Syntax makes damnation habitual.

### Metaphoric Descent
"we descend one step further toward Hell"—**intransitive verb** with directional prep phrases. Syntax makes movement gradual, measured.

### Negative Accompaniment
"Without horror"—**prepositional phrase** of manner. Syntax emphasizes numbness, loss of moral feeling.

### Final Prepositional Atmosphere
"through stinking shadows"—**prepositional phrase** of means. Syntax surrounds descent with sensory corruption.

### Stylistic Effect
Through emphatic cleft construction, paradoxical oxymoron, incremental descent metaphor, and "without horror" negation, Baudelaire creates syntax of moral numbness—grammar that tracks humanity's casual journey toward damnation.
