# Passage 137: "A Scandal in Bohemia"

## Author and Source
**Arthur Conan Doyle**, "A Scandal in Bohemia" (1891)

## Passage
> To Sherlock Holmes she is always *the* woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Italicization** (ih-tal-ih-sih-ZAY-shun)
*Definition:* Typographic emphasis.
*Example:* "the woman"
*Effect:* Makes definite article into mark of uniqueness.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* "eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex"
*Effect:* Elevates one woman above entire gender.

### **Metonymy** (meh-TAH-nuh-mee)
*Definition:* Associated term for thing.
*Example:* "her sex" for all women.
*Effect:* Creates categorical distinction.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Prepositional Specification
"To Sherlock Holmes"—**prepositional phrase** fronted. Syntax emphasizes perspective as personal, not universal.

### Copulative Eternality
"she is always *the* woman"—**present tense with frequency adverb**. Syntax makes designation timeless.

### Emphatic Article
Italicized "the"—**definite article** given typographic weight. Syntax performs uniqueness through typography.

### Negative Frequency
"I have seldom heard"—**present perfect with frequency adverb**. Syntax emphasizes rarity through negation.

### Infinitive Object
"heard him mention her"—**complex verb phrase** with accusative and infinitive. Syntax shows indirect reporting.

### Prepositional Substitute
"under any other name"—**prepositional phrase** indicating manner. Syntax suggests other names exist but aren't used.

### Locative Metaphor
"In his eyes"—**prepositional phrase** of perception. Syntax makes evaluation visual, observational.

### Compound Verb Dominance
"eclipses and predominates"—**two verbs** coordinated. Syntax doubles the supremacy.

### Genitive Totality
"the whole of her sex"—**complex genitive**. Syntax makes comparison cosmic, categorical.

### Stylistic Effect
Through fronted prepositional perspective, copulative eternal present, italicized emphatic article, negative frequency, and compound verbs of dominance over genitive totality, Doyle creates syntax of singular obsession—grammar that performs Holmes's unique regard through categorical linguistic distinction.
