# Passage 170: "The Handmaid's Tale"

## Author and Source
**Margaret Atwood**, *The Handmaid's Tale* (1985)

## Passage
> Ordinary, said Aunt Lydia, is what you are used to. This may not seem ordinary to you now, but after a time it will. It will become ordinary.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Tautology** (taw-TAH-luh-jee)
*Definition:* Saying same thing twice.
*Example:* "Ordinary...is what you are used to"
*Effect:* Creates circular definition revealing normalization process.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "It will...It will become"
*Effect:* Insists on inevitability of adaptation.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "ordinary" for totalitarian atrocity.
*Effect:* Obscures horror through bland language.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Inverted Copula
"Ordinary...is what you are used to"—**complement-copula-subject** inversion with relative clause. Syntax foregrounds term being defined.

### Reporting Verb
"said Aunt Lydia"—**inverted reporting verb**. Syntax interrupts definition with speaker attribution.

### Relative Clause Definition
"what you are used to"—**interrogative relative** defining ordinary. Syntax makes accustomization the essence.

### Deictic Reference
"This"—**demonstrative pronoun** for totalitarian system. Syntax gestures at unnamed horror.

### Modal Negation
"may not seem ordinary"—**epistemic modal** with negative. Syntax acknowledges current perception.

### Temporal Vagueness
"after a time"—**temporal phrase** without specifics. Syntax refuses to specify duration of adaptation.

### Future Certainty
"it will"—**future modal** expressing prediction. Syntax asserts inevitability.

### Future Copulative
"It will become ordinary"—**future copula** completing normalization. Syntax makes adaptation into transformation.

### Stylistic Effect
Through inverted copulative tautology, interrupted attribution, relative what-you're-used-to definition, demonstrative this-horror, modal may-not-seem acknowledgment, vague after-a-time, and double future will/will-become inevitability, Atwood creates syntax of totalitarian normalization—grammar showing how authority redefines ordinary through circular logic and temporal inevitability, making horror mundane through linguistic assertion.
