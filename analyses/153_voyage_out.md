# Passage 153: "The Voyage Out"

## Author and Source
**Virginia Woolf**, *The Voyage Out* (1915)

## Passage
> She had been walking for some time before she realized what it was that had happened. The streets were empty, the houses shut up, and she was alone.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions.
*Example:* "streets were empty, the houses shut up, and she was alone"
*Effect:* Creates accumulating observations without causal connection.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "the streets...the houses...she"
*Effect:* Builds parallel observations of emptiness.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement.
*Example:* "for some time" understates delayed realization.
*Effect:* Emphasizes disconnection from immediate experience.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Past Perfect Progression
"had been walking"—**past perfect progressive**. Syntax shows ongoing action before moment of realization.

### Temporal Vagueness
"for some time"—**indefinite duration**. Syntax refuses specificity, shows consciousness adrift.

### Temporal Subordinate
"before she realized"—**subordinate clause** of delayed awareness. Syntax separates action from understanding.

### Nominal What-Clause
"what it was that had happened"—**interrogative clause** with past perfect. Syntax shows uncertainty about even naming the event.

### Serial Observation
"streets were empty, houses shut up, she was alone"—**three parallel copulative constructions**. Syntax accumulates perceptions.

### Passive Participle
"shut up"—**past participle** implying agent. Syntax removes actors from scene.

### Copulative Isolation
"she was alone"—**subject-copula-complement**. Syntax makes solitude a state of being.

### Stylistic Effect
Through past perfect progressive dissociation, vague temporal duration, delayed realization subordinated, nominal uncertainty about what happened, serial empty/shut/alone observations, and final copulative isolation, Woolf creates syntax of belated consciousness—grammar showing how understanding lags behind experience, leaving character walking unaware through emptiness until understanding catches up.
