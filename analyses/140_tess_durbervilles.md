## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to surface.
*Example:* "Justice" in quotation marks for execution of innocent.
*Effect:* Exposes law's injustice through typographic distancing.

### **Allusion** (uh-LOO-zhun)
*Definition:* Reference to other work.
*Example:* "President of the Immortals" from Aeschylus.
*Effect:* Links Tess's fate to Greek tragedy; elevates to cosmic injustice.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "ended his sport" for torture and execution.
*Effect:* Makes divine cruelty seem casual, playful.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* God as "President" engaged in "sport"
*Effect:* Makes deity into cruel bureaucrat playing games.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Scare Quotes
"Justice"—**quotation marks** around abstract noun. Syntax signals narrator's ironic distance.

### Passive Construction
"was done"—**passive voice** without agent. Syntax presents outcome as inevitable, completed.

### Copulative Title
"the President of the Immortals"—**definite article with genitive**. Syntax gives formal, official title to deity.

### Parenthetical Attribution
"in Aeschylean phrase"—**prepositional phrase** crediting classical source. Syntax makes cosmic view authorized by tradition.

### Past Perfect Completion
"had ended his sport"—**past perfect** emphasizes finality. Syntax marks game's conclusion.

### Possessive Genitive
"his sport with Tess"—**genitive construction** makes Tess object of divine amusement. Syntax performs objectification.

### Prepositional Victimization
"with Tess"—**preposition** showing Tess as plaything. Syntax reduces protagonist to toy.

### Stylistic Effect
Through ironic scare quotes, passive completion, classical allusion as authorization, past perfect finality, and genitive making Tess object of divine sport, Hardy creates syntax of cosmic injustice—grammar that indicts both human law ("Justice") and divine order (President's "sport") through bitter irony and classical elevation.
