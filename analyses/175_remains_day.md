## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation/qualification.
*Example:* "seems increasingly likely" for decided action.
*Effect:* Shows butler's characteristic over-formality and hesitation.

### **Euphemism** (YOO-fuh-miz-um)
*Definition:* Mild expression for harsh reality.
*Example:* "expedition" for simple road trip.
*Effect:* Elevates mundane travel with pompous language.

### **Periphrasis** (puh-RIF-ruh-sis)
*Definition:* Roundabout expression.
*Example:* "has been preoccupying my imagination now for some days" for "I've been thinking about"
*Effect:* Creates distance from direct admission of desire.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Impersonal Subject
"It seems"—**existential with cognitive verb**. Syntax removes speaker as agent of judgment.

### Adverbial Escalation
"increasingly likely"—**adverb modifying adjective**. Syntax shows gradual probability increase.

### Subordinate Clause
"that I really will undertake"—**nominal clause** as subject. Syntax embeds intention in impersonal shell.

### Emphatic Adverb
"really"—**intensifier** before modal. Syntax adds emphasis while maintaining uncertainty.

### Future Modal
"will undertake"—**future auxiliary** with formal verb. Syntax uses elevated diction for simple action.

### Relative Clause
"that has been preoccupying"—**restrictive relative** with perfect progressive. Syntax describes ongoing mental state.

### Present Perfect Progressive
"has been preoccupying"—**aspect showing duration**. Syntax emphasizes extended period of thought.

### Object
"my imagination"—**possessive with elevated noun**. Syntax uses "imagination" rather than simple "mind."

### Temporal Vagueness
"now for some days"—**temporal phrase** refusing specifics. Syntax avoids committing to exact duration.

### Stylistic Effect
Through impersonal it-seems subject, escalating increasingly-likely modality, subordinate I-really-will embedding, formal undertake-expedition diction, perfect progressive has-been-preoccupying, elevated my-imagination object, and vague for-some-days temporality, Ishiguro creates syntax of butler's repression—grammar that makes simple decision about road trip into elaborate formal circumlocution, revealing character's inability to directly acknowledge desires.
