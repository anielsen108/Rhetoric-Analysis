# Passage 175: Hesitant Departure (*The Remains of the Day*)

**Kazuo Ishiguro** · *The Remains of the Day* · 1989 | Opening sentence

**Occasion/Pressure:** Introduce Stevens’s road-trip narrative by showing his reflexive self-effacement even when announcing a plan.
**Persona/Stance:** First-person butler narrator masking desire with formality.
**Thesis of Effect:** Impersonal constructions, hedging adverbs, and perfect-progressive aspect reveal a man who cannot state intention directly.

---

## PASSAGE

[L1] It seems increasingly likely that I really will undertake the expedition that has been preoccupying my imagination now for some days.

---

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Litotes**
**Evidence:** "increasingly likely" softens certainty; "really" hedges.
**Effect:** Understatement exposes Stevens’s reluctance to assert himself.

### **Periphrasis**
**Evidence:** "undertake the expedition" instead of "take the trip."
**Effect:** Overformal phrasing disguises simple desire.

### **Euphemism**
**Evidence:** "expedition" for modest motoring holiday.
**Effect:** Elevates errand to dignified mission, preserving butler persona.

### **Metonymy**
**Evidence:** "imagination" standing for his inner longing.
**Effect:** Creates distance from personal feelings.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Impersonal "It" construction**
**Evidence:** "It seems increasingly likely…"
**Effect:** Removes Stevens as agent of decision.

### **Nominal clause subject**
**Evidence:** "that I really will undertake…"
**Effect:** Embeds intention in subordinate structure, delaying confession.

### **Perfect progressive relative clause**
**Evidence:** "that has been preoccupying my imagination."
**Effect:** Highlights ongoing obsession while maintaining formal tone.

### **Temporal vagueness**
**Evidence:** "now for some days."
**Effect:** Avoids concrete timeline, reflecting hesitancy.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Self-effacing narration**
**Signals:** Impersonal constructions, qualifiers.
**Effect:** Character revealed through grammatical restraint.

### **Bureaucratic diction**
**Signals:** "undertake," "expedition."
**Effect:** Butler transforms personal wish into professional memo.

### **Clause stacking**
**Signals:** Multiple subordinate clauses in single sentence.
**Effect:** Suggests mind circling decision rather than leaping into action.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Soft sibilants (seems, increasingly) soothe; only hard stop is "some days."

**Cadence:** Sentence unfurls gently, mirroring cautious thought process.

**Music:** Like polite throat-clearing before admission; tone measured and genteel.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:** Impersonal subject → evaluation verb → nominal clause → relative clause → temporal modifier.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** Dummy "It" plus adverbial "increasingly" set mood.
- **Mid:** Modal "really will" intensifies yet hedges.
- **Postposed:** Relative clause and temporal phrase stretch confession.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Entirely subordinated; no coordination.

**Information flow:** Tentative observation → suppressed intention → acknowledgement of persistent daydream → vague timeframe.

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"I suppose I'll finally take the trip I've been thinking about."* — Loses polished repression.
- **Dilated:** *"It now appears, with mounting probability, that I truly shall undertake the motoring expedition that for several days has occupied the better part of my imagination."* — Retains register while amplifying fussiness.

---

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deixis:** Absence of concrete place/time keeps plan abstract.

**Aspect:** Present perfect progressive ("has been preoccupying") underscores sustained rumination.

**Modality:** Modal "will" softened by adverbs "seems," "increasingly," "really."

**Temporal logic:** Present decision emerges from days of contemplation; future action still tentative.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:** Travel framed as expedition; imagination as workspace.

**Lexical fields:** Probability, duty, cognition, time.

**Image logic:** Private longing disguised as professional obligation.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** Stevens narrates to presumed reader (Miss Kenton? self?).

**Time:** Opening of road-trip frame narrative; chronology still prospective.

**Beat structure:** Assessment of likelihood → admission of plan → acknowledgment of mental fixation.

**Subtext:** Emotional repression; fear of indulgence.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Precise diction reinforces reliability and professionalism.

**Pathos:** Reader senses yearning beneath manners.

**Logos:** Logical structure of probability leading to action persuades self as much as reader.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Butler narrative tradition:** Echoes Henry James’s polite self-effacement.

**Modernist interiority:** Resonates with Proust’s reflective clauses.

**Postwar British restraint:** Aligns with Muriel Spark’s controlled voices.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"It seems increasingly likely"** — classic Stevens hedge.
2. **"I really will undertake"** — rare moment of assertiveness immediately buffered.
3. **"preoccupying my imagination"** — reveals secret obsession.

### Faultlines
- Tension between desire and duty.
- Impersonal syntax vs. personal longing.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove "really"—sentence becomes cooler, less revealing of inner emphasis.

**Amplification test:** Specify destination—would break suspense about Darlington connections.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"It appears increasingly probable that I shall undertake the excursion occupying my imagination."*
- **Colloquial:** *"Looks like I’m actually going to take that trip I’ve been daydreaming about."*

**Punctuation swap:** Insert dash before relative clause—adds drama but disrupts smoothness.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *It seems ever more probable that I shall compose the letter which has lingered in my thoughts for several evenings.*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *I'm going on a trip.* — Lacks character voice.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *It seems likely I will take the expedition that has occupied my imagination these past days.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Use impersonal "It seems" to mask personal agency.
2. Stack qualifiers to portray chronic hesitation.
3. Swap simple nouns for elevated synonyms to reveal class identity.
4. Deploy perfect-progressive aspect to show lingering preoccupation.
5. End sentence with temporal vagueness to keep plans noncommittal.
6. Let modal "will" peek through to hint at desire.
7. Balance courtesy with confession to build complex narrator.
