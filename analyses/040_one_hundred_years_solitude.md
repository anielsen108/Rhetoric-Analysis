## Rhetorical Tropes

### **In Medias Res** (in MAY-dee-us RAYZ)
*Definition:* Beginning in middle of action.
*Example:* Opens with character facing execution, then flashes back.
*Effect:* Creates immediate tension; foreshadows tragedy while evoking innocence.

### **Prolepsis** (pro-LEP-sis)
*Definition:* Flash-forward to future event.
*Example:* "Many years later...was to remember"—future looking back at past.
*Effect:* Creates complex temporality; past, present, future exist simultaneously.

### **Juxtaposition** (juk-stuh-puh-ZIH-shun)
*Definition:* Placement of contrasting elements together.
*Example:* "firing squad" next to "discover ice"—death beside wonder.
*Effect:* Captures novel's magical realism: violence and innocence coexist.

### **Magical Realism** (MAJ-ih-kul REE-uh-liz-um)
*Definition:* Fantastic elements treated as ordinary.
*Example:* Discovering ice as momentous as facing death.
*Effect:* Elevates everyday wonder; makes the mundane magical.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Temporal Complexity
"Many years later"—the **temporal phrase** opens without specifying from when. The syntax creates multiple time frames immediately.

### Subordinate Temporal Clause
"as he faced the firing squad"—this **temporal subordinate clause** provides the future moment. The syntax uses "as" (simultaneous action) and present tense "faced" (though in future context), creating immediacy.

### Future Perfect Construction
"was to remember"—this **idiomatic future perfect** ("was to" + infinitive) creates complex temporality. From the past of narration, we project forward to a future moment (firing squad) when he will remember further past (childhood).

The syntax creates three time layers in one sentence:
1. Narrative past (base time)
2. Future (facing firing squad)
3. Distant past (discovering ice)

### Relative Clause
"that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice"—the **relative clause** specifies what he'll remember. The modifier "distant" emphasizes temporal remove.

### Infinitive of Purpose
"to discover ice"—the **infinitive** expresses purpose. The verb "discover" (not "see" or "touch") elevates the experience to exploration, making ice exotic, wondrous.

The syntax treats ice discovery as significant as facing death—both get equal grammatical weight in the sentence structure.

### Proper Noun
"Colonel Aureliano Buendía"—the **full name with title** creates formality and specificity. The syntax establishes him as historical figure worthy of full nomenclature.

### Single Sentence
The entire opening is **one complex sentence** containing a complete life arc: childhood wonder to military rank to execution. The syntax compresses biography into 29 words.

### Stylistic Effect
Through complex temporal syntax, juxtaposition of death and wonder, and compression of time, García Márquez creates the opening for magical realism's masterpiece. The form performs the content: time isn't linear but circular, layered, simultaneous. Past and future coexist in present syntax. This is grammar as time machine, syntax as magical realism itself.
