# Passage 097: "The Second Sex"

## Author and Source
**Simone de Beauvoir**, *The Second Sex* (1949)

## Passage
> One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "not born, but rather becomes"
*Effect:* Separates biology from social construction; emphasizes process over essence.

### **Asyndeton** (uh-SIN-duh-tahn)
*Definition:* Omission of conjunctions.
*Example:* "biological, psychological, or economic fate" (only final "or").
*Effect:* Accumulates rejected determinisms rapidly.

### **Apposition** (ap-uh-ZIH-shun)
*Definition:* Noun phrase restating another.
*Example:* "this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch"
*Effect:* Defines woman as absence, negation.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Passive Negation
"One is not born"—**passive construction with negation**. Syntax denies biological essentialism through passive voice that removes agency.

### Adversative Conjunction
"but rather becomes"—**coordinating conjunction** with intensifier "rather." Syntax pivots from essence to process.

### Indefinite Pronoun
"One"—**impersonal pronoun** instead of "a woman." Syntax creates philosophical distance, universalizes claim.

### Triple Negative Subjects
"No biological, psychological, or economic fate"—**negative determiner** with three adjectives. Syntax systematically rejects determinist explanations.

### Emphatic Cleft
"it is civilization as a whole that produces"—**cleft sentence** emphasizes agent. Syntax foregrounds social construction.

### Relative Clause Definition
"which is described as feminine"—**passive relative clause**. Syntax shows femininity as description imposed, not inherent quality.

### Appositive Degradation
"intermediate between male and eunuch"—**appositive phrase** defines woman as neither/nor. Syntax creates woman as negation.

### Stylistic Effect
Through passive negation, adversative pivot from being to becoming, emphatic cleft foregrounding civilization, and degrading apposition, de Beauvoir creates syntax of existentialist feminism—grammar that makes gender construction, not nature.
