## Author and Source
**Maya Angelou**, *And Still I Rise* (1978)

## Passage

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "You may" repeated.
*Effect:* Creates parallel structure of oppression met with resistance.

### **Simile** (SIM-ih-lee)
*Definition:* Explicit comparison.
*Example:* "like dust, I'll rise"
*Effect:* Transforms instrument of oppression (dust) into image of resilience.

### **Antithesis** (an-TIH-thuh-sis)
*Definition:* Balanced opposition.
*Example:* "You may...But still, I'll rise"
*Effect:* Sets oppression against indomitable spirit.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Modal Permission
"You may"—**modal auxiliary** expressing permission. Syntax concedes oppressor's power while preparing to transcend it.

### Adversative Conjunction
"But still"—**coordinating conjunction** with intensifier creates strong opposition. Syntax pivots from concession to defiance.

### Future Tense
"I'll rise"—**future tense** with contraction creates certainty and immediacy. Syntax makes resistance inevitable.

### Stylistic Effect
Through modal concessions met with future certainty, parallel structure of oppression answered by rising, Angelou creates syntax of triumphant resistance—grammar that performs undefeatable spirit.
