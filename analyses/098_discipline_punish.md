# Passage 098: "Discipline and Punish"

## Author and Source
**Michel Foucault**, *Discipline and Punish* (1975)

## Passage
> He who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relation in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of clauses.
*Example:* "he...he...he...he" repeated.
*Effect:* Creates relentless accumulation; shows internalization process.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Seemingly contradictory statement.
*Example:* Person becomes "principle of his own subjection"
*Effect:* Shows how power works through self-surveillance.

### **Chiasmus** (ky-AZ-mus)
*Definition:* Inverted parallel structure.
*Example:* Subjected TO visibility → inscribes power IN himself.
*Effect:* Shows internalization of external control.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Relative Clause Subject
"He who is subjected"—**relative clause** defining pronoun. Syntax makes subjectivity dependent on being observed.

### Passive Construction
"is subjected to"—**passive voice** emphasizes being acted upon. Syntax shows subject as object of visibility.

### Parenthetical Knowledge
"and who knows it"—**additional relative clause**. Syntax emphasizes consciousness of surveillance as key.

### Active Transformation
"assumes responsibility"—**active verb** shows shift from passive to active. Syntax tracks internalization.

### Causative Construction
"makes them play"—**causative verb** with infinitive. Syntax shows subject compelling power's mechanisms.

### Reflexive Pronoun
"upon himself"—**prepositional phrase with reflexive**. Syntax performs the turning inward of power.

### Metaphor of Inscription
"he inscribes in himself"—**transitive verb** with reflexive object. Syntax makes body text, written by power.

### Adverbial Simultaneity
"simultaneously plays both roles"—**adverb with dual objects**. Syntax captures subject/object doubling.

### Copulative Transformation
"he becomes the principle"—**copula** marks complete internalization. Syntax shows subject AS power's mechanism.

### Stylistic Effect
Through anaphoric accumulation, passive-to-active transformation, reflexive pronouns, and copulative identification, Foucault creates syntax of internalized surveillance—grammar that performs Panopticon's operation through increasingly self-directed clauses.
