# Passage 006: The Great Gatsby's Green Light

## Author and Source
**F. Scott Fitzgerald**, *The Great Gatsby* (1925), Chapter 1

## Passage
> Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning—

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Symbolism** (SIM-buh-liz-um)
*Definition:* Use of an object to represent abstract ideas.
*Example:* The green light representing hope, the American Dream, Daisy, and unattainable desires.
*Effect:* Gives concrete form to abstract longing; allows multiple meanings to coexist.

### **Personification** (per-sah-nif-ih-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Attribution of human qualities to non-human things.
*Example:* The future "recedes"; time acts as an agent.
*Effect:* Makes time and fate seem willful, deliberately thwarting human desire.

### **Aposiopesis** (ap-oh-sigh-oh-PEE-sis)
*Definition:* Sudden breaking off of speech, leaving a sentence unfinished.
*Example:* "And one fine morning—"
*Effect:* Suggests the impossibility of articulating the dream; the future remains forever unfinished.

### **Ellipsis** (ee-LIP-sis)
*Definition:* Omission of words from a sentence.
*Example:* The trailing "stretch out our arms farther..." and "And one fine morning—"
*Effect:* Creates sense of infinite continuation; suggests dreams that extend beyond words.

### **Polysyndeton** (pol-ee-SIN-duh-ton)
*Definition:* Use of multiple conjunctions in close succession.
*Example:* "run faster, stretch out our arms farther..."
*Effect:* Creates breathless momentum; suggests accumulating effort and desperation.

### **Prolepsis** (pro-LEP-sis)
*Definition:* Flash-forward to future events or preemptive action.
*Example:* "tomorrow we will run faster"
*Effect:* Expresses perpetual deferral of satisfaction; tomorrow never comes.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Sentence Pattern
This passage demonstrates what Tufte calls **syntactic fragmentation paired with incompletion**. We have complete sentences followed by an **aposiopesis**—a sentence that literally cannot complete itself, mirroring the theme of unattainable dreams.

### Opening Statement
"Gatsby believed in the green light"—this is a **simple declarative sentence**, subject-verb-object, but loaded with significance through noun choice. The syntax is plain; the semantics are infinite. This is characteristic of Fitzgerald: deceptively simple sentences bearing enormous weight.

### Appositive Structure
"the orgastic future" serves as an **appositive** to "the green light," grammatically equating the two. The syntax creates an equivalence: light = future. This is syntax doing the work of metaphor.

### Relative Clause as Movement
"that year by year recedes before us"—this **relative clause** is crucial. It modifies "future" and transforms a noun into a verb phrase of movement. The syntax makes the future active (it recedes) and humans passive (it recedes "before us," implying we're stationary or slower).

### The Adversative "But"
"but that's no matter"—this **short independent clause** interrupts the pattern. The syntax here is deliberately colloquial, almost dismissive. The dash after "matter" creates a pivot point in the passage's movement.

### Future Tense and Will Power
"tomorrow we will run faster"—the **future tense** combined with **modal auxiliary "will"** expresses determination. The syntax is **declarative but not confident**; it's assertion without certainty. The future tense itself is ironic—we're always planning for tomorrow.

### Parallel Verb Phrases
"will run faster, stretch out our arms farther"—two **parallel verb phrases** sharing the auxiliary "will." Notice both use **comparatives** ("faster," "farther") but no comparison is stated. Faster than what? Farther than whom? The syntax implies eternal competition with ourselves.

### Cumulative Movement
The passage builds through **accumulation**: belief → futility → renewed determination → eternal hope. Each syntactic unit adds momentum even as the content describes futility.

### Strategic Use of Ellipsis
The three dots after "farther" create **syntactic suspension**—the sentence could continue forever, listing more and more efforts. This is syntax as visual metaphor for infinite striving.

### The Final Aposiopesis
"And one fine morning—" The sentence breaks off. The **em-dash** is one of the most famous punctuation marks in American literature. It represents:
- Syntactic: incompletion
- Thematic: unattainability
- Temporal: a future that never arrives
- Emotional: hope that cannot be articulated

### Pronouns: We vs. Us
Note the shift from "us" (objective case) to "we" (subjective case):
- "recedes before us" (we are objects)
- "It eluded us" (we are objects)
- "we will run" (we become subjects)

The syntax charts a movement from passivity to agency, though the final dash suggests this agency is illusory.

### Rhythm and Sound
The passage has an **iambic tendency**:
- "Gats-BY be-LIEVED in the GREEN light"
- "to-MOR-row we will RUN fast-ER"

This rhythmic quality gives the prose a poetic, almost incantatory feeling—these are articles of faith, not mere observations.

### Tense Shifts
The passage moves through tenses:
- Past: "Gatsby believed"
- Present: "recedes before us"
- Past: "It eluded us"
- Present: "that's no matter"
- Future: "tomorrow we will run"

This **temporal fluidity** suggests that the pattern is timeless—it happened, is happening, will happen.

### Stylistic Effect
Through strategic incompletion and cumulative syntax, Fitzgerald creates prose that **enacts** the American Dream: forever reaching, forever falling short, forever beginning again. The syntax doesn't resolve because the dream can't. The famous dash is where syntax meets theme—the sentence breaks because the dream is unattainable. This is Tufte's principle in action: syntax doesn't just convey meaning but **is** meaning. Form and content are inseparable.
