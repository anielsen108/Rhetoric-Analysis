# Passage 059: "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"

## Author and Source

> And all the boards did shrink;
> Water, water, every where,
> Nor any drop to drink.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Epizeuxis** (ep-ih-ZOOK-sis)
*Definition:* Immediate repetition of words.
*Example:* "Water, water" repeated twice.
*Effect:* Creates obsessive focus; emphasizes abundance that torments.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning of lines.
*Example:* Lines 1 and 3 begin identically.
*Effect:* Creates incantatory rhythm; emphasizes paradox of plenty without use.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Seemingly contradictory statement containing truth.
*Example:* Surrounded by water but unable to drink—abundance becomes torture.
*Effect:* Captures the mariner's curse: nature's plenty turned useless.

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Outcome opposite to what's expected.
*Example:* Ocean = water = life, but here means death.
*Effect:* Subverts normal associations; makes ocean threatening rather than sustaining.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Noun Repetition
"Water, water"—the **repeated noun** without conjunction creates desperate emphasis. The **comma** between creates pause, making each utterance separate yet connected.

### Adverb of Extent
"every where"—Coleridge's spelling **"every where"** (two words, not "everywhere") creates rhythmic expansion. The syntax spreads the word across two metrical feet.

### Coordinate Clause
"And all the boards did shrink"—the **coordinating conjunction** links observation of water to its effect on ship. The **auxiliary "did"** + verb creates emphasis (archaic/poetic usage).

The **subject "all the boards"** with **quantifier "all"** makes the shrinking universal—every plank affected.

### Exact Repetition
Lines 3 repeats line 1 exactly—**syntactic and lexical identity**. This is pure anaphora, creating obsessive circling back to the central reality: water everywhere.

### Negative Construction
"Nor any drop to drink"—the **negative conjunction "Nor"** (not "And not") creates formal, archaic register. The syntax is compressed: [there is] nor any drop to drink.

The **quantifier "any"** with negative makes this absolute—not even one drop.

The **infinitive "to drink"** expresses purpose/possibility that's denied. The syntax sets up potential (drops one might drink) then negates it.

### Ballad Meter
The passage uses **ballad stanza** (alternating 4-beat and 3-beat lines). The syntax must fit this metrical constraint, creating compression:
- "Water, water, every where" (4 beats)
- "And all the boards did shrink" (3 beats)
- "Water, water, every where" (4 beats)
- "Nor any drop to drink" (3 beats)

The **syntactic compression** serves metrical requirements while creating meaning.

### Paratactic Structure
The four lines use **simple coordination** ("And...Nor")—no subordination, no complex embedding. This syntactic simplicity creates directness, as if these are simple facts, though they're describing supernatural curse.

### Article Usage
Note the progression:
- "Water" (no article—abstract, universal)
- "the boards" (definite—specific ship's planks)
- "any drop" (indefinite—not even one)

The **syntax through article choice** moves from universal to particular to negative possibility.

### Verb Tense
"did shrink"—**past tense** with emphatic auxiliary. This happened, definitively. Versus "to drink"—**infinitive** expressing possibility, not actuality.

The **tense contrast** creates temporal layering: past event (boards shrank) versus ongoing impossibility (can't drink).

### Stylistic Effect
Through repetition, ballad meter, and stark simplicity, Coleridge creates one of poetry's most famous paradoxes. The form performs the content: the repeated "Water, water" creates excess linguistically while describing unusable excess physically. The syntax circles obsessively (anaphora) around the central irony. The compressed negative ("Nor any drop") makes deprivation absolute. This is grammar as curse—syntax that repeats and repeats without solution, trapped in its own patterns like the mariner trapped in his punishment. The form IS the torment.
