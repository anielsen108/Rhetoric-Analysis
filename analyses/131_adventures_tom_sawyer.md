# Passage 131: "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"

## Author and Source
**Mark Twain**, *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer* (1876)

## Passage
> Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Personification** (per-sah-nuh-fuh-KAY-shun)
*Definition:* Human qualities to abstractions.
*Example:* "gladness left him"; "melancholy settled down"
*Effect:* Makes emotions into active agents that come and go.

### **Hyperbole** (hy-PER-buh-lee)
*Definition:* Exaggeration.
*Example:* "Life...seemed hollow, and existence but a burden"
*Effect:* Inflates boyhood chore into existential crisis.

### **Bathos** (BAY-thahs)
*Definition:* Descent from elevated to trivial.
*Example:* From cosmic despair to whitewashing fence.
*Effect:* Creates humor through disproportion.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Simple Past Appearance
"Tom appeared"—**simple subject-verb**. Syntax introduces character in medias res.

### Compound Prepositional Objects
"with a bucket...and a long-handled brush"—**two coordinated objects**. Syntax emphasizes burden of equipment.

### Intransitive Survey
"He surveyed the fence"—**simple transitive**. Syntax marks moment of assessment.

### Personified Departure
"all gladness left him"—**subject-verb** with personified emotion. Syntax makes happiness an agent that abandons.

### Opposite Arrival
"a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit"—**subject-verb** with spatial metaphor. Syntax shows depression as weight descending.

### Sentence Fragment Measurement
"Thirty yards...nine feet high"—**fragment** without verb. Syntax performs Tom's stunned calculation.

### Copulative Despair
"Life...seemed hollow, and existence but a burden"—**two parallel copulative constructions** with elevated diction. Syntax ironically deploys philosophical language for boyhood task.

### Litotes in "but"
"but a burden"—**adversative** reducing existence to single quality. Syntax compresses despair.

### Stylistic Effect
Through personified emotional departure/arrival, fragment of measurement, copulative existential despair, and bathos of philosophical language for fence-painting, Twain creates syntax of comic proportion—grammar that performs boyhood melodrama through ironic elevation of trivial to cosmic.
