# Passage 174: "Midnight's Children"

## Author and Source
**Salman Rushdie**, *Midnight's Children* (1981)

## Passage
> I was born in the city of Bombay... once upon a time. No, that won't do, there's no getting away from the date: I was born in Doctor Narlikar's Nursing Home on August 15th, 1947. And the time? The time matters, too. Well then: at night. No, it's important to be more... On the stroke of midnight, as a matter of fact.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Aposiopesis** (ap-oh-sy-oh-PEE-sis)
*Definition:* Trailing off, self-interruption.
*Example:* "No, that won't do"; "No, it's important to be more..."
*Effect:* Performs narrator's self-correction, obsessive precision.

### **Anaphora** (uh-NAF-or-uh)
*Definition:* Repetition at beginning.
*Example:* "I was born...I was born"
*Effect:* Insists on birth narrative despite interruptions.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement through negation.
*Example:* "there's no getting away from the date"
*Effect:* Understates historical significance of Indian independence.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Passive Birth
"I was born"—**passive construction**. Syntax makes narrator object of birth.

### Locative Prepositional
"in the city of Bombay"—**spatial preposition** with genitive. Syntax specifies birthplace.

### Formulaic Opening
"once upon a time"—**fairy tale formula**. Syntax invokes storytelling tradition.

### Adversative Negation
"No, that won't do"—**interjection with future negative**. Syntax rejects previous sentence.

### Existential Negative
"there's no getting away from"—**existential with gerund**. Syntax shows inescapability.

### Temporal Specification
"on August 15th, 1947"—**precise date**. Syntax anchors to Indian independence.

### Interrogative Raise
"And the time?"—**coordinate with elliptical question**. Syntax introduces new obsessive detail.

### Declarative Answer
"The time matters, too"—**subject-verb-adverb**. Syntax asserts importance.

### Tentative Hedging
"Well then: at night"—**interjection with vague time**. Syntax tries and fails at specificity.

### Second Rejection
"No, it's important to be more..."—**negative with truncated comparative**. Syntax shows perfectionist dissatisfaction.

### Prepositional Precision
"On the stroke of midnight"—**temporal idiom** with exactitude. Syntax finally achieves satisfactory precision.

### Hedging Formula
"as a matter of fact"—**formulaic phrase**. Syntax adds emphasis to finally-achieved specificity.

### Stylistic Effect
Through repeated passive I-was-born, fairy-tale once-upon-a-time attempt, adversative no-that-won't-do rejections, existential no-getting-away-from, precise date anchoring Indian independence, interrogative time-raising, multiple hedging attempts, truncated self-corrections, and final on-stroke-of-midnight precision with formulaic emphasis, Rushdie creates syntax of obsessive narration—grammar that performs narrator's compulsive need for exactitude about birth coinciding with nation's birth.
