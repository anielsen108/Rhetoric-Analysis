# Passage 177: Interview Posture (*Infinite Jest*)

**David Foster Wallace** · *Infinite Jest* · 1996 | Year of Glad opening scene

**Occasion/Pressure:** Hal Incandenza sits before admissions interviewers, performing composure while anxiety fragments perception.
**Persona/Stance:** Hyper-self-aware first-person narrator dissociating under scrutiny.
**Thesis of Effect:** Passive constructions, synecdochic observers, and paradoxical environment details display a mind over-monitoring itself inside institutional theater.

## PASSAGE

[L1] I am seated in an office, surrounded by heads and bodies.
[L2] My posture is consciously congruent to the shape of my hard chair.
[L3] This is a cold room in University Administration, wood-walled, Remington-hung, double-windowed against the November heat.

## A) RHETORICAL TROPES USED

### **Synecdoche**
**Evidence:** "heads and bodies" for whole people.
**Effect:** Dehumanizes administrators; Hal perceives parts, not persons.

### **Zeugma**
**Evidence:** "surrounded by heads and bodies"—one preposition governs mismatched objects.
**Effect:** Highlights fragmentation and discomfort.

### **Paradox**
**Evidence:** "November heat."
**Effect:** Signals warped corporate calendar and narrator’s anxious scrutiny.

### **Cataloguing**
**Evidence:** "wood-walled, Remington-hung, double-windowed."
**Effect:** Accumulates sensory detail obsessively.

---

## B) RHETORICAL SCHEMES USED

### **Passive voice**
**Evidence:** "I am seated."
**Effect:** Removes agency; Hal objectified by interview setting.

### **Adjectival doubling**
**Evidence:** "consciously congruent."
**Effect:** Self-conscious redundancy underscores overcontrol.

### **Hyphenated participles**
**Evidence:** "wood-walled, Remington-hung, double-windowed."
**Effect:** Creates rhythmic triad of modifiers.

### **Prepositional chains**
**Evidence:** "in an office…in University Administration…against the November heat."
**Effect:** Box-in Hal via spatial clauses.

---

## C) MODERN SYNTACTICAL APPROACHES USED

### **Hyper-awareness syntax**
**Signals:** Every bodily adjustment narrated.
**Effect:** Conveys performance anxiety.

### **Institutional surveillance**
**Signals:** Surrounding "heads" plus impersonal location names.
**Effect:** Readers feel constant observation.

### **Paratactic cataloguing**
**Signals:** Adjacent descriptive fragments.
**Effect:** Mimics rapid sensory intake under stress.

---

## 1) EAR & PROSODY

**Mouthfeel:** Alternation of hard stops (hard chair) and hissed consonants (surrounded) mimic tense breath.

**Cadence:** L1 short; L2 measured; L3 sprawling, piling descriptors like racing thoughts.

**Music:** Crescendo from clipped awareness to lush, claustrophobic detail.

---

## 2) SYNTAX AS STYLE (Tufte-grade)

**Sentence shape:**
- L1: Passive clause + participial phrase.
- L2: Copular clause with predicate nominative.
- L3: Copular clause followed by cumulative modifiers.

**Modification choreography:**
- **Preposed:** None; sentences start with subject.
- **Mid:** Adverb "consciously" inserted before adjective.
- **Postposed:** Strings of participles and prepositional phrases elongate description.

**Coordination/subordination ratio:** Predominantly coordination via commas; minimal subordination.

**Information flow:** Physical position → bodily control → environmental surveillance.

**Micro-rewrites:**
- **Compressed:** *"I sit in an office, trying to match my posture to the chair. The room is wood-paneled and hung with Remingtons despite November heat."* — Clear but loses passive pressure.
- **Dilated:** *"I find myself seated in an office, encompassed by heads and torsos, my posture consciously conforming to the geometry of this hard chair, in a cold University Administration room paneled in wood, decorated with Remington prints, double-windowed against the paradoxical November heat."* — Retains neurosis while expanding.

## 3) DEIXIS, ASPECT, MODALITY

**Deixis:** Indefinite "an office" vs. definite "This" underscores disorientation turning to hyper-focus.

**Aspect:** Present progressive implied by "I am seated"; static moment stretched.

**Modality:** Absence of modal verbs heightens factual tone despite tension.

**Temporal logic:** Narrative frozen in interview moment; time dilates through description.

---

## 4) IMAGE SYSTEM & FIELD

**Metaphor families:** Body as machine calibrating to furniture; institution as hunting lodge (Remington prints).

**Lexical fields:** Anatomy, architecture, surveillance, climate.

**Image logic:** Academic bureaucracy commodifies both art and bodies, pressing Hal into compliance.

---

## 5) NARRATIVE MECHANICS

**Focalization:** First-person interior monologue filtered through anxious observational lens.

**Time:** Micro-second of interview stretched into tableau.

**Beat structure:** Position acknowledged → self-control asserted → environment catalogued.

**Subtext:** Hal’s prodigious mind cannot stop monitoring itself; language hints at impending communicative failure.

---

## 6) APPEALS & STRATEGY

**Ethos:** Detailed observation demonstrates intelligence and training.

**Pathos:** Reader feels claustrophobic empathy for performer under pressure.

**Logos:** Logical ordering of body → chair → room mirrors Hal’s attempt to impose structure.

---

## 7) LINEAGE & KINSHIPS

**Institutional dread:** Echoes Kafka’s bureaucratic nightmares.

**Postmodern interiority:** Aligns with Don DeLillo’s forensic descriptions.

**Academic satire:** Shares DNA with Richard Powers’s high-cerebral narrators.

---

## 8) HOTSPOTS & FAULTLINES

### Hotspots
1. **"I am seated"** — immediate passivity.
2. **"heads and bodies"** — chilling synecdoche.
3. **"double-windowed against the November heat"** — paradox establishing tone.

### Faultlines
- Tension between composed exterior and frantic interior.
- Surreal climate detail hints at broader satire of corporate academia.

---

## 9) REVISION STUDIO

**Subtraction test:** Remove "consciously"—lose neurotic self-monitoring.

**Amplification test:** Add heartbeat description—might tip into melodrama, but could intensify panic.

**Register shift:**
- **Formal:** *"I find myself seated within an administrative office, encircled by heads and bodies."*
- **Colloquial:** *"I’m parked in this admin office, ringed by heads and torsos."*

**Punctuation swap:** Replace commas in L3 with semicolons—would create abrupt segmentation, less breathless.

---

## 10) IMITATIO / COUNTER-IMITATIO

**Imitatio:** *I am stationed at the conference table, hemmed in by wrists and watches. My spine aligns itself with the chair’s grid.*

**Counter-Imitatio:** *I sit in a room with people and paintings.* — Drains style and tension.

**Compression (≤25 words):** *I am seated in an office among heads and bodies, posture tuned to the hard chair in a cold administrative room double-windowed against November heat.*

---

## 11) STEAL THIS (Takeaways)

1. Use passive voice to dramatize institutional control.
2. Break people into parts to show alienation.
3. Stack hyphenated participles for sensory overload.
4. Deploy paradoxical detail to signal satire.
5. Let body-language vocabulary reveal psychological strain.
6. Sequence description from self → environment to mimic widening perception.
7. Keep present tense to heighten immediacy.
