# Passage 177: "Infinite Jest"

## Author and Source
**David Foster Wallace**, *Infinite Jest* (1996)

## Passage
> I am seated in an office, surrounded by heads and bodies. My posture is consciously congruent to the shape of my hard chair. This is a cold room in University Administration, wood-walled, Remington-hung, double-windowed against the November heat.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Zeugma** (ZOOG-muh)
*Definition:* Verb governing different objects.
*Example:* "surrounded by heads and bodies" - body parts standing for whole people.
*Effect:* Creates dissociative, fragmented perception.

### **Paradox** (PAIR-uh-doks)
*Definition:* Seeming contradiction.
*Example:* "November heat"
*Effect:* Signals unreliable narration or unusual circumstances.

### **Synecdoche** (sin-ECK-duh-kee)
*Definition:* Part for whole.
*Example:* "heads and bodies" for people.
*Effect:* Dehumanizes, fragments observers into components.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Passive Stative
"I am seated"—**passive construction**. Syntax removes narrator's agency in sitting.

### Prepositional Location
"in an office"—**spatial preposition** with indefinite article. Syntax establishes institutional setting.

### Participial Surround
"surrounded by heads and bodies"—**past participle** with fragmented objects. Syntax makes narrator object of others' encirclement.

### Synecdochic Objects
"heads and bodies"—**coordinated body parts**. Syntax dissects people into anatomical components.

### Possessive Posture
"My posture"—**possessive with physical noun**. Syntax makes body position deliberate object of attention.

### Adverbial Consciousness
"consciously congruent"—**manner adverb** with adjective. Syntax emphasizes deliberate bodily control.

### Prepositional Conformity
"to the shape of my hard chair"—**spatial preposition** with genitive. Syntax shows body molding to furniture.

### Copulative Definition
"This is a cold room"—**demonstrative subject** with copula. Syntax defines space through temperature.

### Prepositional Institution
"in University Administration"—**locative with capitalized bureaucracy**. Syntax elevates setting to proper noun.

### Participial Attributes
"wood-walled, Remington-hung, double-windowed"—**three hyphenated past participles**. Syntax accumulates descriptive details.

### Paradoxical Prepositional
"against the November heat"—**opposition preposition** with seasonal contradiction. Syntax creates impossible weather.

### Stylistic Effect
Through passive seated position, synecdochic heads-and-bodies fragmentation, adverbial consciously-congruent posture, participial wood-walled/Remington-hung accumulation, and paradoxical windowed-against-November-heat, Wallace creates syntax of hyperconscious anxiety—grammar that performs narrator's dissociative self-monitoring and perceptual fragmentation under institutional pressure.
