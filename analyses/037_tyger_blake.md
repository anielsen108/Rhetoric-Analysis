## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Apostrophe** (uh-PAH-struh-fee)
*Definition:* Direct address to absent entity.
*Example:* Speaking directly to the tiger.
*Effect:* Creates intimacy and intensity; makes philosophical question personal.

### **Rhetorical Question** (rih-TOR-ih-kul KWES-chun)
*Definition:* Question asked for effect, not answer.
*Example:* "What immortal hand or eye, / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?"
*Effect:* Expresses wonder and terror; implies no answer exists.

### **Epizeuxis** (ep-ih-ZOOK-sis)
*Definition:* Immediate repetition for emphasis.
*Example:* "Tyger Tyger"
*Effect:* Creates incantatory, ritualistic quality; emphasizes obsessive focus.

### **Oxymoron** (ok-see-MOR-on)
*Definition:* Combination of contradictory terms.
*Example:* "fearful symmetry"—beauty that terrifies.
*Effect:* Captures the paradox of creation: order and terror unified.

### **Synesthesia** (sin-es-THEE-zhuh)
*Definition:* Mixing of sensory impressions.
*Example:* "burning bright"—visual phenomenon described with thermal term.
*Effect:* Makes the tiger's appearance intense, almost supernatural.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Vocative Repetition
"Tyger Tyger"—the **repeated vocative** (direct address) creates incantatory opening. Blake's archaic spelling "Tyger" (not "Tiger") adds mystical quality. The syntax through repetition creates ritual invocation.

### Present Participle
"burning bright"—the **participial phrase** modifies "Tyger." The syntax makes the burning an ongoing state, not momentary. The tiger IS burning, continuously, eternally.

### Spatial Paradox
"In the forests of the night"—the **prepositional phrase** creates impossible geography. Forests exist in space; night exists in time. The syntax through preposition "in" treats night as spatial location, creating mystical fusion of time and space.

### Interrogative Syntax
"What immortal hand or eye, / Could frame"—the **question begins with interrogative pronoun "What"** seeking identification. The syntax uses **disjunctive "or"** (hand OR eye), suggesting creator might work through either means.

The **modal auxiliary "Could"** expresses ability/capacity, not mere possibility. The question asks: what being has the POWER to create this?

### Verb Choice
"frame"—means to construct, design, create structure. The syntax through verb choice emphasizes the tiger as crafted artifact, not natural evolution. This is intentional design.

### Possessive and Modifier
"thy fearful symmetry"—the **archaic possessive "thy"** creates formal, Biblical register. The **oxymoronic phrase "fearful symmetry"** places terror and beauty in perfect grammatical balance (adjective + noun). The syntax makes fear and order inseparable.

### Stylistic Effect
Through vocative repetition, archaic diction, rhetorical questions, and oxymoronic phrasing, Blake creates syntax of mystical inquiry. The form performs wonder and terror simultaneously—the questions don't seek answers but express awe. Syntax as prayer and challenge to Creator.
