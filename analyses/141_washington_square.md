# Passage 141: "Washington Square"

## Author and Source
**Henry James**, *Washington Square* (1880)

## Passage
> It must be added that she had a very slender repertoire of smiles, and that these were all produced upon the recommendation of her father.

## Rhetorical Tropes

### **Metaphor** (MET-uh-for)
*Definition:* Implicit comparison.
*Example:* Smiles as "repertoire" - theatrical/musical term.
*Effect:* Makes spontaneous emotion into performed routine.

### **Irony** (EYE-ruh-nee)
*Definition:* Meaning opposite to surface.
*Example:* Smiles "recommended" by father.
*Effect:* Shows how patriarchal control extends to facial expressions.

### **Litotes** (LY-tuh-teez)
*Definition:* Understatement.
*Example:* "very slender repertoire" understates severe emotional constriction.
*Effect:* Creates restrained, polite tone for describing repression.

## Syntax as Style Analysis

### Passive Necessity
"It must be added"—**modal passive** without agent. Syntax presents observation as obligatory disclosure.

### Relative Clause Possession
"that she had"—**subordinate clause** stating possession. Syntax treats smiles as objects she owns.

### Adjectival Diminishment
"a very slender repertoire"—**indefinite article with intensified adjective**. Syntax minimizes through measurement metaphor.

### Genitive Specification
"of smiles"—**prepositional phrase** defining repertoire's contents. Syntax makes facial expressions into catalog items.

### Coordinating Addition
"and that these were"—**conjunction introducing parallel clause**. Syntax adds second diminishment.

### Passive Production
"were all produced"—**passive voice** with universal quantifier. Syntax removes Catherine's agency in her own smiling.

### Prepositional Cause
"upon the recommendation of her father"—**complex prepositional phrase**. Syntax makes paternal suggestion into manufacturing instruction.

### Stylistic Effect
Through modal passive obligation, slender repertoire metaphor, passive production removing agency, and prepositional cause making father the recommender of daughter's facial expressions, James creates syntax of patriarchal micromanagement—grammar showing how Dr. Sloper controls even Catherine's spontaneous emotional displays.
